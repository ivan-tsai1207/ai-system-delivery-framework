## Objective

## Write Scope

## Forbidden Scope

- `.ai/**`

- `docs/04_system/**`
- `docs/08_agent_reviews/manifests/**`

## Scope

- Verify traversal/absolute path rejection, unsupported glob rejection, contradictory scope detection, missing-target fail-closed behavior, dependency integrity, immutable output, and non-expansion.
- Validate closure of `FND-HNS-EXEC-001-TECH-001-001`, `FND-HNS-EXEC-001-TECH-001-002`, and `FND-HNS-EXEC-001-TECH-001-003` where applicable, plus known-risk regressions.

## Out of Scope

- Candidate modification, open-ended fuzzing, speculative grammar taxonomies, remediation, Gate approval, adapters, enforcement, or later milestone work.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `AC-HNS-EXEC-001-SECURITY-REVIEW-002-001`: Exact R2 identity, dependency provenance, and independent binding are valid.
- [ ] `AC-HNS-EXEC-001-SECURITY-REVIEW-002-002`: R1 security-relevant findings close with bounded adjacent negative controls.
- [ ] `AC-HNS-EXEC-001-SECURITY-REVIEW-002-003`: No filesystem write, broad scan, process, credential, network, adapter, enforcement, or production capability is introduced.
- [ ] `AC-HNS-EXEC-001-SECURITY-REVIEW-002-004`: Evidence and findings are appended only to the review log.

## Required Gates

- `IMPLEMENTATION_GATE`

## Dependencies

- `HNS-EXEC-001`

## Blockers

- None

## Notes

- Decision is `PASS`, `REQUEST_CHANGES`, or `BLOCK` only; a new MAJOR/BLOCKING generalized finding triggers the review-loop stop rule.
