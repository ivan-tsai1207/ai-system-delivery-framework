## Scope

- Validate registered/matching reviewer binding, bounded invalid bindings, parser/state normal and negative behavior, deterministic immutability, test discovery, and prior CORE regressions.
- Verify exact R3 identity and direct regressions for `FND-HNS-EXEC-001-TECH-002-001` without expanding review taxonomy.

## Out of Scope

- Open-ended fuzzing, unrelated parser grammar, new attack taxonomies, candidate modification, remediation, Gate approval, Context Compiler, adapters, enforcement, or later milestone work.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `AC-HNS-EXEC-001-QA-REVIEW-003-001`: All HNS-EXEC-001 ACs map to reproducible exact-R3 evidence.
- [ ] `AC-HNS-EXEC-001-QA-REVIEW-003-002`: Registered reviewer binding passes and directly affected invalid bindings fail closed.
- [ ] `AC-HNS-EXEC-001-QA-REVIEW-003-003`: Full and focused suites pass without failure, cancellation, skip, todo, or regression.
- [ ] `AC-HNS-EXEC-001-QA-REVIEW-003-004`: Evidence and findings are appended only to the review log.

## Required Gates

- `IMPLEMENTATION_GATE`

## Dependencies

- `HNS-EXEC-001`

## Blockers

- None

## Notes

- A same-finding failure stops as `TARGETED_REMEDIATION_FAILED`; a new unrelated MAJOR/BLOCKING finding stops as `NEW_MAJOR_FINDING`.
