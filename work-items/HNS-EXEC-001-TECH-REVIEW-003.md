## Objective

Independently verify exact R3 closure of `FND-HNS-EXEC-001-TECH-002-001` and directly affected HNS-EXEC-001 regressions without expanding the review taxonomy.

## Scope

- Verify exact R3 manifest/candidate identity, Maker/Reviewer separation, targeted diff scope, and exact-runtime validation.
- Verify registered reviewed-artifact path and exact hash metadata PASS behavior plus nonexistent, unregistered, traversal, absolute, unsupported metadata, hash mismatch, and malformed binding fail-closed behavior.
- Regress only directly affected canonical parser, dependency, capability, immutability, and execution-state boundaries.

## Out of Scope

- Open-ended fuzzing, unrelated parser grammar, new attack taxonomies, candidate modification, remediation, Gate approval, Context Compiler, adapters, enforcement, or later milestone work.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `AC-HNS-EXEC-001-TECH-REVIEW-003-001`: R3 identity, lineage, manifest hash, artifact hashes, diff scope, and separation are valid.
- [ ] `AC-HNS-EXEC-001-TECH-REVIEW-003-002`: `FND-HNS-EXEC-001-TECH-002-001` closes with exact registered artifact/hash verification and bounded negative regressions.
- [ ] `AC-HNS-EXEC-001-TECH-REVIEW-003-003`: Direct HNS-EXEC-001 regressions, build, typecheck, tests, audit, and capability boundaries pass without new unrelated MAJOR/BLOCKING finding.
- [ ] `AC-HNS-EXEC-001-TECH-REVIEW-003-004`: Evidence and findings are appended only to the review log.

## Required Gates

- `IMPLEMENTATION_GATE`

## Dependencies

- `HNS-EXEC-001`

## Blockers

- None

## Notes

- If the same finding remains unresolved, stop as `TARGETED_REMEDIATION_FAILED`; a new unrelated MAJOR/BLOCKING finding stops as `NEW_MAJOR_FINDING`.
