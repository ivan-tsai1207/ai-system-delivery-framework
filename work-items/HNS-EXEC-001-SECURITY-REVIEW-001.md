## Scope

- Verify repository-relative path rejection, traversal and absolute-path handling, unsafe Markdown/input behavior, dependency integrity, immutable output, diagnostic non-disclosure, and capability non-expansion.
- Use bounded canonical negative cases and dependency audit only.

## Out of Scope

- Open-ended fuzzing, arbitrary grammar taxonomies, modifying candidate artifacts, remediation, Gate approval, adapters, enforcement, or later milestone work.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `AC-HNS-EXEC-001-SECURITY-REVIEW-001-001`: Exact candidate identity, dependency provenance, and independent binding are valid.
- [ ] `AC-HNS-EXEC-001-SECURITY-REVIEW-001-002`: Traversal, absolute path, malformed review binding, unsafe scope, and hostile object boundaries fail closed without disclosure.
- [ ] `AC-HNS-EXEC-001-SECURITY-REVIEW-001-003`: Outputs remain immutable and no filesystem write, process, credential, network, adapter, enforcement, or production capability is introduced.
- [ ] `AC-HNS-EXEC-001-SECURITY-REVIEW-001-004`: Findings and decision are appended only to the review log.

## Required Gates

- `IMPLEMENTATION_GATE`

## Dependencies

- `HNS-EXEC-001`

## Blockers

- None

## Notes

- Decision is `PASS`, `REQUEST_CHANGES`, or `BLOCK` only.
