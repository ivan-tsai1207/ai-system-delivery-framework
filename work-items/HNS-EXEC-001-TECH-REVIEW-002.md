## Objective

Independently verify the exact R2 remediation, all three R1 finding closures, complete technical behavior, and immutable candidate identity.

## Scope

- Verify exact lineage, bounded target registry, glob rejection/overlap semantics, parser/state correctness, dependency impact, scope, typing, and exact-runtime validation.
- Validate closure of `FND-HNS-EXEC-001-TECH-001-001`, `FND-HNS-EXEC-001-TECH-001-002`, and `FND-HNS-EXEC-001-TECH-001-003` where applicable, plus known-risk regressions.

## Out of Scope

- Candidate modification, open-ended fuzzing, speculative grammar taxonomies, remediation, Gate approval, adapters, enforcement, or later milestone work.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `AC-HNS-EXEC-001-TECH-REVIEW-002-001`: R2 manifest identity, lineage, diff scope, and separation are valid.
- [ ] `AC-HNS-EXEC-001-TECH-REVIEW-002-002`: All three R1 findings close without regression or unauthorized capability.
- [ ] `AC-HNS-EXEC-001-TECH-REVIEW-002-003`: Build, typecheck, complete tests, audit, and bounded technical probes pass on exact R2.
- [ ] `AC-HNS-EXEC-001-TECH-REVIEW-002-004`: Evidence and findings are appended only to the review log.

## Required Gates

- `IMPLEMENTATION_GATE`

## Dependencies

- `HNS-EXEC-001`

## Blockers

- None

## Notes

- Decision is `PASS`, `REQUEST_CHANGES`, or `BLOCK` only; a new MAJOR/BLOCKING generalized finding triggers the review-loop stop rule.
