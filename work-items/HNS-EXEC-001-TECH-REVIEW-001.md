## Objective

Independently verify HNS-EXEC-001 correctness, SDD compliance, dependency impact, scope, typing, and immutable candidate identity.

## Scope

- Verify exact manifest hash, candidate commit, Maker/Reviewer separation, authorized diff, parser/state correctness, exact dependency, and required validation.
- Use bounded checks tied to canonical ACs and high-confidence parser/state boundaries.

## Out of Scope

- Modifying candidate artifacts, broad parser fuzzing, QA/Security substitution, remediation, Gate approval, adapters, enforcement, or later milestone work.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `AC-HNS-EXEC-001-TECH-REVIEW-001-001`: Candidate identity, dependency lock, diff scope, and separation are valid.
- [ ] `AC-HNS-EXEC-001-TECH-REVIEW-001-002`: Parser and state APIs satisfy direct SDD and Work Item requirements without unauthorized capability.
- [ ] `AC-HNS-EXEC-001-TECH-REVIEW-001-003`: Build, typecheck, complete tests, and bounded technical probes pass on the exact candidate.
- [ ] `AC-HNS-EXEC-001-TECH-REVIEW-001-004`: Findings and decision are appended only to the review log.

## Required Gates

- `IMPLEMENTATION_GATE`

## Dependencies

- `HNS-EXEC-001`

## Blockers

- None

## Notes

- Decision is `PASS`, `REQUEST_CHANGES`, or `BLOCK` only.
