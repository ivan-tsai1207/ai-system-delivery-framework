## Scope

- Validate registered target and exact SHA metadata, nonexistent/unregistered/traversal/absolute/unsupported/malformed/mismatched bindings, immutable outputs, and no capability expansion.
- Verify exact R3 identity and direct regressions for `FND-HNS-EXEC-001-TECH-002-001` without expanding review taxonomy.

## Out of Scope

- Open-ended fuzzing, unrelated parser grammar, new attack taxonomies, candidate modification, remediation, Gate approval, Context Compiler, adapters, enforcement, or later milestone work.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `AC-HNS-EXEC-001-SECURITY-REVIEW-003-001`: R3 identity, manifest hash, dependency provenance, and independent binding are valid.
- [ ] `AC-HNS-EXEC-001-SECURITY-REVIEW-003-002`: Targeted finding closes across canonical positive and bounded negative security cases.
- [ ] `AC-HNS-EXEC-001-SECURITY-REVIEW-003-003`: No scan, filesystem write, process, credential, network, adapter, enforcement, or production capability is introduced.
- [ ] `AC-HNS-EXEC-001-SECURITY-REVIEW-003-004`: Evidence and findings are appended only to the review log.

## Required Gates

- `IMPLEMENTATION_GATE`

## Dependencies

- `HNS-EXEC-001`

## Blockers

- None

## Notes

- A same-finding failure stops as `TARGETED_REMEDIATION_FAILED`; a new unrelated MAJOR/BLOCKING finding stops as `NEW_MAJOR_FINDING`.
