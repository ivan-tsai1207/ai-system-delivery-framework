Open findings：`BLOCKING = 0`、`MAJOR = 0`。

### Known Limitations and Unresolved Issues

- Maker Execution ID was not included in the external review result; independence is recorded through the external reviewer provenance and distinct review execution ID.
- Git blob SHA is Git object identity and is not used as the canonical artifact SHA-256.
- Approval applies only to the exact normative SDD bytes at the reviewed commit / blob / SHA-256. Any normative body change invalidates this PASS.

### Result

- Reviewer Decision：`PASS`.
- Phase 1 Readiness：`READY`.
- Blocking Findings：`0`.
- Major Findings：`0`.

### Integrity and Independence Validation

- [x] Reviewed commit、Git blob與exact artifact SHA-256已由evidence recorder重新驗證一致。
- [x] Reviewer Profile為外部review result指定的`SPEC_REVIEWER`。
- [x] Evidence recorder未修改reviewed normative body後沿用PASS。
- [x] External Reviewer未由本次Codex execution冒充或重新產生。

| `IG-HNS-CORE-001-001-05` | Build, typecheck, smoke test, and audit evidence is valid | `npm ci`, `npm run build`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm audit --audit-level=high`, and `npm pack --dry-run` all exited `0` in fresh gate checkout | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-001-001-06` | Acceptance Criteria complete | `AC-HNS-CORE-001-001` through `AC-HNS-CORE-001-004` validated by package metadata, TypeScript config, smoke tests, no runtime behavior, and scoped diff | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-001-001-07` | No open blocking finding | `REV-HNS-CORE-001-TECH-001` records no blocking, major, minor, or observation findings; gate execution found no open blocking finding | `PASS` |

### Test Evidence

| Command | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `node --version && npm --version` | `v24.16.0`; `11.13.0` | Local gate checkout was below the pinned package engine floor, so `npm ci` emitted `EBADENGINE` warnings only; package metadata and smoke tests still pin the required `>=24.19.0 <25` and `>=11.17.0 <12` policy. |
| `npm ci` | `PASS` (`exit 0`) | Added 2 packages, audited 3 packages, found 0 vulnerabilities. |
| `npm run build` | `PASS` (`exit 0`) | `tsc --project tsconfig.json` completed. |
| `npm run typecheck` | `PASS` (`exit 0`) | `tsc --project tsconfig.json --noEmit` completed. |
| `npm test` | `PASS` (`exit 0`) | Node test runner: 3 tests, 3 pass, 0 fail. |
| `npm audit --audit-level=high` | `PASS` (`exit 0`) | Found 0 vulnerabilities. |
| `npm pack --dry-run` | `PASS` (`exit 0`) | Package preview contains compiled ESM output and package metadata only. |

### Risk-Based Review Requirements

- `TECH_REVIEWER`：required for implementation review and satisfied by `REV-HNS-CORE-001-TECH-001` with decision `PASS`.
- `QA_REVIEWER`：not required. Risk Class is `MEDIUM`; canonical Risk Policy requires QA for MEDIUM only by artifact / behavior trigger. HNS-CORE-001 is a package/config-only foundation with deterministic smoke/config tests and introduces no product behavior, acceptance workflow, regression surface, adapter, runtime, API, DB schema, role, permission, UX flow, or production operation.
- `SECURITY_REVIEWER`：not required. Security trigger is absent because the implementation adds no runtime dependency, credential handling, authentication, authorization, external API, data sensitivity, security boundary, migration, destructive operation, or production deployment path.

### Acceptance Criteria Validation

- `AC-HNS-CORE-001-001`：Package metadata uses ESM and pins Node/npm policy; TypeScript config uses strict mode with `NodeNext` module and resolution.
- `AC-HNS-CORE-001-002`：`package-lock.json` exists; clean install, build, typecheck, and test scripts executed successfully.
- `AC-HNS-CORE-001-003`：Smoke tests pass; source exports only a package marker and contains no vendor adapter or runtime behavior.
- `AC-HNS-CORE-001-004`：Implementation diff contains only HNS-CORE-001 Write Scope files and no canonical governance changes.

### Open Findings

None.

### Status Updates

- `work-items/HNS-CORE-001.md` status updated from `REVIEW` to `DONE`.
- `work-items/HNS-CORE-001-TECH-REVIEW.md` status updated from `TODO` to `DONE`.
- HNS-CORE-002 was not started.
- No merge from `main` or any other branch was performed.
- Harness implementation files were not modified after the reviewed implementation commit.

  - Control-plane remediation WI creation: `work-items/HNS-CORE-002-TEST-FIX.md`.
  - HNS-CORE-002-TEST-FIX remediation implementation: `harness/package.json`.
- Diff Scope：Matches the required lineage split and does not treat control-plane Work Item creation as an HNS-CORE-002 implementer scope violation.
- Unauthorized Change Check：No parser, filesystem I/O, process execution, persistence, adapter, runtime orchestration, vendor dependency, broad `any`, unauthorized SDD / Architecture / governance modification, or HNS-CORE-003 implementation found in reviewed implementation.
- Backward Compatibility：TypeScript build, typecheck, tests, and package audit pass under required engines.

### Findings

| Finding ID | Review Profile | Owner Role | Work Item | Artifact / Hash | Requirement Reference | Description | Severity | Evidence Reference | Required Action | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `FIND-HNS-CORE-002-TECH-001` | `TECH_REVIEWER` | `IMPLEMENTER` | `HNS-CORE-002` | `harness/src/core/domain.ts` / `059650ba908d2694e97d3dfff0a3f527c0f65033c018a62874ec0a241e97c6aa` | `AC-HNS-CORE-002-003`; SDD Section 5 immutable value output | `freezeCoreValue` uses one global `WeakSet` for traversal and never removes objects after descending, so a legitimate shared reference such as `{ a: shared, b: shared }` is rejected as a circular reference. This violates the required distinction between circular references and shared references. | `MAJOR` | Runtime probe: `defineCoreValue({ a: shared, b: shared })` throws `Core domain values must not contain circular references.` | Track recursion stack separately from already-frozen/shared objects, or otherwise allow acyclic shared references while still rejecting true cycles. | `OPEN` |
| `FIND-HNS-CORE-002-TECH-002` | `TECH_REVIEWER` | `IMPLEMENTER` | `HNS-CORE-002` | `harness/src/core/domain.ts` / `059650ba908d2694e97d3dfff0a3f527c0f65033c018a62874ec0a241e97c6aa` | HNS-CORE-002 immutable value contracts; SDD Section 5 immutable domain values | `defineCoreValue` freezes only own enumerable properties. Mutable non-plain objects such as `Date` and `Map` remain internally mutable after wrapping; runtime probes changed a frozen `Date` year to `2027` and added an entry to a frozen `Map`. That leaves values only superficially frozen, not immutable. | `MAJOR` | Runtime probes: `withDate.when.setUTCFullYear(2027)` succeeds; `withMap.values.set("b", 2)` succeeds. | Reject unsupported mutable non-plain objects or convert/freeze them with an explicit immutable representation. | `OPEN` |
| `FIND-HNS-CORE-002-TECH-003` | `TECH_REVIEWER` | `IMPLEMENTER` | `HNS-CORE-002` | `harness/tests/unit/core/domain.test.mjs` / `92c59ce06c4f5c545dd4b802395fffb7248e8efb64a03fa8128fe34df0c4d9fa` | HNS-CORE-002 Scope: tests for allowed values; `AC-HNS-CORE-002-002`; `AC-HNS-CORE-002-003` | `WORK_ITEM_STATUSES` is exported by the implementation but is not imported or asserted in `domain.test.mjs`. The test named `canonical work item enums match the SDD and Work Item Contract` verifies roles, phases, risk classes, profiles, and gates, but omits the canonical Work Item Status allowed values. | `MAJOR` | `rg WORK_ITEM_STATUSES harness/tests/unit/core/domain.test.mjs` returns no match; `npm test` passes without status value assertions. | Add an explicit unit test assertion for `WORK_ITEM_STATUSES` values: `TODO`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `BLOCKED`, `REVIEW`, `DONE`, `CANCELLED`. | `OPEN` |

### Known Limitations and Unresolved Issues

- Known Limitations：This is a `TECH_REVIEWER` decision only and does not run or pass `IMPLEMENTATION_GATE`.
- Unresolved Issues：Three open MAJOR findings require implementer remediation and re-review before a PASS candidate.
- Accepted Risk References：`N/A`

### Result

Reviewer decision：`REQUEST_CHANGES`.

GateResult：`N/A`; `IMPLEMENTATION_GATE` remains pending.

### Integrity and Independence Validation

- [x] Artifact hash與實際 reviewed version一致。
- [x] Maker與 final Checker execution ID不同。
- [x] Reviewer Profile由 `work-items/HNS-CORE-002-TECH-REVIEW.md` 指派。
- [x] Reviewer execution未修改受審 artifact。
- [x] Required evidence與 findings已寫入受控 audit / review log。
- [x] Artifact變更後舊 PASS需標示失效或 superseded。

A getter can return one plain object during traversal, then return a different fresh mutable plain object after `Object.freeze` freezes the container; an accessor-backed proxy can do the same. This leaves a value reachable from a frozen domain object mutable after construction. | `MAJOR` | Runtime probe: after `defineCoreValue(accessorPlain)`, `Object.isFrozen(frozenAccessor.nested)` is `false`; after `defineCoreValue(proxyWithAccessor)`, `Object.isFrozen(frozenProxy.nested)` is `false` | Reject accessor properties / proxy-like dynamic object semantics or materialize values into data properties before freezing so all reachable values remain immutable after construction. | `OPEN` |

### Known Limitations and Unresolved Issues

- This review records a `TECH_REVIEWER` decision only. It does not execute `QA_REVIEWER`, pass `IMPLEMENTATION_GATE`, merge branches, or start HNS-CORE-003.
- `npm ci` created ignored `harness/node_modules/` and build created ignored `harness/dist/` in the temporary review checkout; these were not staged or committed.
- Existing findings are recorded as resolved in this R2 evidence only; prior review evidence is not modified.

### Result

Reviewer decision：`REQUEST_CHANGES`.

### Integrity and Independence Validation

- [x] Fresh clone / checkout preflight passed for the assigned repository and branch.
- [x] Manifest hash matches the expected reviewed artifact hash.
- [x] Maker and Reviewer execution IDs are distinct.
- [x] Reviewer Profile was assigned by `work-items/HNS-CORE-002-TECH-REVIEW-002.md`.
- [x] Reviewer execution did not modify the reviewed manifest or reviewed implementation files.
- [x] Required independent review evidence and findings were appended only to `docs/08_agent_reviews/review_log.md`.

### Implementer Scope Evidence

- Changed Files：R3 candidate commit `1599ca268c89f2ed2e130ecb159b16f89da2a8b5` changes only `harness/src/core/domain.ts` and `harness/tests/unit/core/domain.test.mjs` relative to R2 review evidence commit `0df54ae9f1ff26889b8d47f33c05d091326c6aa7`.
- Diff Scope：The implementation delta is limited to immutable core value snapshot behavior and related regression tests.
- Unauthorized Change Check：No parser, filesystem I/O, process execution, persistence, adapter, runtime orchestration, vendor dependency, broad `any`, HNS-CORE-003 work, governance, SDD, Architecture, or unrelated Work Item implementation scope found.
- Backward Compatibility：Domain package API remains vendor-neutral and side-effect-free; canonical enums and exported types remain unchanged.

### Findings

| Finding ID | Review Profile | Owner Role | Work Item | Artifact / Hash | Requirement Reference | Description | Severity | Evidence Reference | Required Action | Status |

Proxy descriptor snapshots, nested accessors, symbol accessors, shared aliases, true cycles, unsupported mutable values, arrays, sparse arrays, null-prototype objects, symbol-keyed data, and source/result isolation were independently verified. | `MAJOR` | `REV-HNS-CORE-002-TECH-003-05` through `REV-HNS-CORE-002-TECH-003-08`; Reviewer Runtime Probe | None | `RESOLVED` |

### Known Limitations and Unresolved Issues

- This review records a `TECH_REVIEWER` decision only. It does not execute `QA_REVIEWER`, pass `IMPLEMENTATION_GATE`, merge branches, perform lifecycle closure, or start HNS-CORE-003.
- `npm ci` created ignored `harness/node_modules/` and build created ignored `harness/dist/` in the temporary review checkout; these were not staged or committed.
- No new findings were opened.

### Result

Reviewer decision：`PASS`.

GateResult：`N/A`; `IMPLEMENTATION_GATE` remains pending.

### Integrity and Independence Validation

- [x] Artifact hash與實際 reviewed version一致。
- [x] Maker與 final Checker execution ID不同。
- [x] Reviewer Profile由 `work-items/HNS-CORE-002-TECH-REVIEW-003.md` 指派。
- [x] Reviewer execution未修改受審 artifact、implementation、manifest、work items、SDD、Architecture或governance。
- [x] Required independent review evidence and findings were appended only to `docs/08_agent_reviews/review_log.md`.
- [x] Artifact變更後舊 PASS失效規則未被覆寫；本 evidence 綁定 R3 manifest hash與 candidate commit。

### Regression / Runtime Probe Summary

- Probe execution used inline `node --input-type=module` against built `harness/dist/index.js` and did not write probe files into the repository.
- Probe groups passed: canonical domain contract enums; `assertOneOf`; shared alias identity; genuine cycle rejection; ordinary accessor rejection without getter calls; nested accessor rejection without getter calls; symbol accessor rejection without getter calls; proxy descriptor snapshot behavior; symbol-key data preservation; `Date` / `Map` / `Set` / `WeakMap` / `WeakSet` / custom class / function rejection; source/result isolation and nested freeze; null-prototype object handling; ordinary/nested/sparse array handling; repeatability.

### Findings

No new QA findings.

`FIND-HNS-CORE-002-TECH-004` is cited as resolved by `REV-HNS-CORE-002-TECH-003`; this QA review independently validated the same behavior but does not change or impersonate TECH finding closure.

### Known Limitations and Unresolved Issues

- `npm ci` created ignored `harness/node_modules/` and build created ignored `harness/dist/` in the temporary QA checkout; these were not staged or committed.
- This review records a `QA_REVIEWER` decision only. It does not pass `IMPLEMENTATION_GATE`, merge branches, perform lifecycle closure, start `HNS-CORE-003`, or modify implementation, tests, manifest, work items, SDD, Architecture, governance, or templates.

### Result

Reviewer decision: `PASS`.

GateResult: `N/A`; `IMPLEMENTATION_GATE` remains pending.

### Integrity and Independence Validation

- [x] Artifact hash matches the exact reviewed R3 manifest.
- [x] Candidate, preparation, and TECH review commits are in HEAD lineage in the required order.
- [x] Maker and QA Reviewer execution IDs are distinct.
- [x] QA Reviewer execution ID is distinct from `REV-HNS-CORE-002-TECH-R3-20260818T182246Z`.
- [x] Reviewer Profile was assigned by `work-items/HNS-CORE-002-QA-REVIEW-002.md`.
- [x] Reviewer execution did not modify implementation, tests, manifest, work items, SDD, Architecture, governance, or templates.
- [x] Required independent QA review evidence was appended only to `docs/08_agent_reviews/review_log.md`.
- [x] Artifact change invalidation rules were not overwritten; this evidence binds the R3 manifest hash and candidate commit.

### Acceptance Criteria Validation

| Acceptance Criterion | Result | Evidence Reference |
|---|---|---|
| `AC-HNS-CORE-002-001` | `PASS` | Strict build and typecheck pass; source has no broad `any` or vendor import; scoped search found no parser, I/O, process, adapter, or external capability. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-002-002` | `PASS` | Core enums for four roles, five phases, six statuses, four risk classes, six reviewer profiles, five gate IDs, finding severity/status, reviewer decisions, and gate result statuses match SDD / Work Item Contract exactly and remain distinct. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-002-003` | `PASS` | Checked-in tests and reviewer runtime probes cover valid construction, invalid enum rejection, immutable snapshot behavior, shared aliases, true cycles, accessors, proxy descriptor semantics, symbol-keyed data, and unsupported mutable / non-plain values. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-002-004` | `PASS` | Candidate introduces no parser, I/O, process, persistence, adapter, orchestration, runtime service, HNS-CORE-003 work, or unauthorized scope. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-002-TEST-FIX-001` | `PASS` | Default `npm test` executed root smoke tests from `tests/*.test.mjs`. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-002-TEST-FIX-002` | `PASS` | Default `npm test` executed nested core tests from `tests/unit/core/*.test.mjs`. |

| `AC-HNS-CORE-002-TEST-FIX-004` | `PASS` | Test-discovery remediation is limited to `harness/package.json`; R3 candidate does not modify runtime, parser, adapter, SDD, Architecture, unrelated Work Item, or out-of-scope implementation files. |

### Risk-Based Review Requirements

- `TECH_REVIEWER`: required for implementation review and satisfied by `REV-HNS-CORE-002-TECH-003` with decision `PASS`.
- `QA_REVIEWER`: required because this candidate validates observable domain behavior, regression coverage, and test discovery; satisfied by `REV-HNS-CORE-002-QA-002` with decision `PASS`.
- `SECURITY_REVIEWER`: not required. Canonical LOW risk policy requires Security only on security triggers; none are present because the candidate introduces no authentication, authorization, permission change, secret / credential handling, PII, payment, external API / external write, dependency trust change, filesystem or command boundary behavior, production operation, migration, destructive operation, or security boundary change.

### Open Findings

No unresolved `OPEN BLOCKING` or `OPEN MAJOR` finding remains for the R3 gate candidate.

Final finding states:

| Finding | Final Status | Closure Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `FIND-HNS-CORE-002-TECH-001` | `RESOLVED` | `REV-HNS-CORE-002-TECH-002-06` |
| `FIND-HNS-CORE-002-TECH-002` | `RESOLVED` | `REV-HNS-CORE-002-TECH-002-07` |

### Status Updates

- No Work Item lifecycle closure was performed in this gate execution.
- `work-items/HNS-CORE-002.md` remains `REVIEW`.
- `work-items/HNS-CORE-002-TEST-FIX.md` remains `REVIEW`.
- No implementation, test, manifest, governance, SDD, Architecture, HNS-CORE-003, merge, release, or lifecycle-closure change was made.

### Result

GateResult: `PASS`.

| `REV-HNS-CORE-003-TECH-001-05` | Work Item and evidence binding | Compared assigned review Work Item, three Maker Work Items, manifest metadata, Maker evidence, risk, profile, candidate, and gate | Artifact/hash, Maker identities, `MEDIUM` risk, `TECH_REVIEWER`, and `IMPLEMENTATION_GATE` bindings agree | `PASS` |
| `REV-HNS-CORE-003-TECH-001-06` | Canonical schema and domain alignment | Compared all 12 registered IDs and schema fields/enums/requiredness with SDD Sections 5 and 6 and `templates/Work_Item.md`; independently enumerated and resolved the runtime registry | Exactly 12 canonical IDs in SDD order; accountability, Work Item, execution, policy, audit, bootstrap, context, and project schemas align | `PASS` |
| `REV-HNS-CORE-003-TECH-001-07` | Exact resolution, duplicate, and unknown handling | Source inspection plus independent runtime probes for exact IDs, duplicate registration, malformed IDs, unknown names, and newer versions | Exact IDs resolve; duplicates throw `DUPLICATE_SCHEMA`; unknown names return `UNKNOWN_SCHEMA`; unsupported versions return `UNKNOWN_VERSION`; no fallback | `PASS` |
| `REV-HNS-CORE-003-TECH-001-08` | Registration transaction semantics | Independent probes first registered an invalid-keyword schema or unresolved-reference schema, confirmed public absence, then retried a valid schema with the same `$id` | Both retries failed because Ajv retained the rejected `$id` while `resolve()` and `listSchemaIds()` reported it absent; see `FIND-HNS-CORE-003-TECH-001` | `FAILED` |
| `REV-HNS-CORE-003-TECH-001-09` | Work Item version behavior | Independent runtime probes using v1 legacy and v2 fixtures | v1 returns frozen `MIGRATION_REQUIRED`, target v2, `executable: false`; v2 valid passes; missing/invalid/wrong-version inputs fail closed | `PASS` |

| `REV-HNS-CORE-003-TECH-001-13` | JSON/TypeScript schema duplication | Independently dereferenced all local `$defs`/`$ref` entries in all JSON schemas and compared the normalized documents with the 12 runtime TypeScript schema values | `12` compared; `0` semantic mismatches; duplication does not create a current contract defect | `PASS` |
| `REV-HNS-CORE-003-TECH-001-14` | Exact authorized scope | Compared base-to-candidate changed paths with manifest paths and validated each preparation/dependency/schema/test-discovery commit against its Work Item boundary | Candidate diff and manifest are the same `45` paths; each commit is confined to its authorized paths; no unrelated capability found | `PASS` |
| `REV-HNS-CORE-003-TECH-001-15` | Test discovery integrity | Default runner output plus static `.skip`/`.todo`/`.only` scan | Root, core, and schema tests discovered; no failed, cancelled, skipped, todo, or focused test markers | `PASS` |

### Tests Performed

| Test Type | Command / Runner | Result | Evidence Reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| Environment | Pinned temporary Node distribution; `node --version`; `npm --version`; Node distribution checksum | `PASS` | Node `v24.19.0`; npm `11.17.0`; official archive checksum `OK` |
| Clean Install | `npm ci` in `harness/` | `PASS` | `added 7 packages`; `found 0 vulnerabilities` |
| Build | `npm run build` | `PASS` | `tsc --project tsconfig.json` completed |
| Typecheck | `npm run typecheck` | `PASS` | `tsc --project tsconfig.json --noEmit` completed with strict options |
| Lint | `N/A` | `NOT_APPLICABLE` | No lint script is defined; `git diff --check` and scoped source scans passed |
| Unit / Smoke Test | `npm test` | `PASS` | `tests 52`; `pass 52`; `fail 0`; `cancelled 0`; `skipped 0`; `todo 0` |
| Security Check | `npm audit --audit-level=high` | `PASS` | `found 0 vulnerabilities` |
| Dependency Resolution | `npm ls ajv --all`; `npm ls --depth=0` | `PASS` | Exact runtime dependency `ajv@8.20.0`; only expected direct runtime/dev dependencies |
| Canonical Runtime Probe | Inline Node probe against built `dist/schemas/index.js` | `PASS` | Canonical IDs, exact/unknown/duplicate handling, v1/v2, accountability matrix, deterministic errors, non-mutation, accessor safety |
| JSON/TypeScript Parity Probe | Inline Node semantic normalization and deep comparison | `PASS` | All 12 JSON artifacts exactly matched runtime TypeScript schemas after local reference expansion |
| Registration Rollback Probe | Inline Node probe against built `SchemaRegistry.register()` | `FAILED` | `2/2` failed-compilation cases poisoned the `$id`; valid retry returned `INVALID_SCHEMA_REGISTRATION` with Ajv `already exists` |

### Implementer Scope Evidence

- Changed Files: The candidate changes exactly the 45 paths bound by the manifest: two control-plane companion Work Items, package/lock dependency state, 12 JSON schemas, three schema source modules, 21 fixtures, and five schema test files.
- Diff Scope: Control-plane preparation commit changes only companion Work Items; dependency commit changes only package and lock files; schema commit changes only authorized schema/source/fixture/test paths; test-discovery commit changes only `harness/package.json`.
- Unauthorized Change Check: No implementation, test, schema, manifest, governance, parser, migration engine, compiler, adapter, filesystem/process/network/persistence capability, HNS-CORE-004, HNS-CORE-005, or unrelated artifact was added outside the authorized candidate scope.
- Backward Compatibility: Canonical validation remains fail closed and existing tests pass, but failed dynamic registration leaves hidden Ajv state and prevents a subsequent valid same-ID registration in the same registry instance.

### Findings

| Finding ID | Review Profile | Owner Role | Work Item | Artifact / Hash | Requirement Reference | Description | Severity | Evidence Reference | Required Action | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `FIND-HNS-CORE-003-TECH-001` | `TECH_REVIEWER` | `IMPLEMENTER` | `HNS-CORE-003` | `harness/src/schemas/registry.ts` / manifest `sha256:2e4277a051fc05fe260c4cfea538ca70b9fb0284c8eaa2288e59871a23f8dc58` | `AC-HNS-CORE-003-001`; SDD Section 6 fail-closed/version registry rules; `TECH_REVIEWER` correctness and error-handling checks | `SchemaRegistry.register()` calls `Ajv2020.compile()` before committing its public maps, but does not roll back Ajv when compilation throws. For both an invalid keyword schema and an unresolved `$ref`, the rejected ID is absent from `resolve()`/`listSchemaIds()` yet remains reserved inside Ajv; retrying a valid schema with the same ID fails as already registered. Registry state is therefore non-atomic, internally inconsistent, and order-dependent after rejected input. | `MAJOR` | `REV-HNS-CORE-003-TECH-001-08`; `harness/src/schemas/registry.ts:206`; independent probe reported `POISONED_REGISTRATION_CASES=2` | Make registration transactional so Ajv, schema snapshots, and validators either commit together or fully roll back; add regression tests for valid same-ID retry after invalid-keyword and unresolved-reference compilation failures. A different independent `TECH_REVIEWER` execution must verify the remediated artifact hash; this execution does not close its own finding. | `OPEN` |

### Known Limitations and Unresolved Issues

- `FIND-HNS-CORE-003-TECH-001` remains `OPEN`; no implementation artifact was modified by this Reviewer.
- The 12 JSON schema artifacts and TypeScript runtime schemas are duplicated representations. Independent semantic comparison found no current mismatch, but the checked-in suite does not directly enforce full 12-schema semantic parity.
- This evidence is only a `TECH_REVIEWER` decision. It does not perform QA, Security, any Gate, merge, lifecycle closure, parser/migration implementation, or delivery assurance.
- `npm ci` and build created ignored `harness/node_modules/` and `harness/dist/` in the fresh temporary clone; neither is tracked, staged, or committed.
- Accepted Risk References: `None`.

### Result

Reviewer decision: `REQUEST_CHANGES`.

### Result

`READY_FOR_REVIEW`

`FIND-HNS-CORE-003-TECH-001` remains `OPEN`. This Maker evidence does not close the Finding, produce a Reviewer PASS, or pass `IMPLEMENTATION_GATE`.

GateResult: `N/A`; `IMPLEMENTATION_GATE` was not run.

### Integrity and Independence Validation

- [x] Manifest SHA-256 and every bound artifact Git blob/content SHA-256 match the reviewed candidate.
- [x] Maker and Reviewer execution IDs are different; all Maker identities match the Work Items, manifest, and Maker evidence.
- [x] Reviewer Profile is assigned by `work-items/HNS-CORE-003-TECH-REVIEW-001.md`.
- [x] Reviewer execution did not modify implementation, tests, schemas, manifest, Work Items, package files, governance, or other documentation.
- [x] Required evidence and the open finding were appended only to `docs/08_agent_reviews/review_log.md`.
- [x] This evidence remains bound to candidate `b12b416c51bbd4dc268c5e3d2cdbe811eba7565c` and manifest hash `2e4277a051fc05fe260c4cfea538ca70b9fb0284c8eaa2288e59871a23f8dc58`; any artifact change invalidates it.

### Tests Performed

| Test Type | Command / Runner | Result | Evidence Reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| Environment | Pinned local toolchain; `node --version`; `npm --version` | `PASS` | Node `v24.19.0`; npm `11.17.0` |
| Clean Install | `npm ci` in `harness/` | `PASS` | `added 7 packages`; `found 0 vulnerabilities` |

| Typecheck | `npm run typecheck` | `PASS` | `tsc --project tsconfig.json --noEmit` completed under strict settings |
| Lint | `N/A` | `NOT_APPLICABLE` | No lint script is defined; `git diff --check` and scoped source scans passed |

### Implementer Scope Evidence

- Changed Files: R2 replaces only `harness/src/schemas/registry.ts` and `harness/tests/unit/schemas/registry.test.mjs` within the inherited 45-artifact R1 set.
- Diff Scope: R2 adds Ajv rollback on compile failure and two focused same-ID retry regression tests; no schema, fixture, package, dependency, Work Item, manifest, or unrelated implementation artifact changes in the R2 candidate commit.
- Preparation Isolation: Prior review/preparation commits and R2 review preparation commit changed only review evidence, manifests, and review Work Items; none changed a bound candidate artifact.
- Unauthorized Change Check: No adapter, parser, migrator, compiler, persistence, filesystem, process, network, HNS-CORE-004, HNS-CORE-005, or unrelated capability was introduced.
- Backward Compatibility: Duplicate rejection, canonical registration order, exact resolution, fail-closed version handling, and all R1 tests remain unchanged; the two formerly poisoned registration sequences now recover atomically.

### Finding Resolution

| Finding ID | Review Profile | Owner Role | Work Item | Artifact / Hash | Closure Evidence | Severity | Final Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `FIND-HNS-CORE-003-TECH-001` | `TECH_REVIEWER` | `IMPLEMENTER` | `HNS-CORE-003` | `harness/src/schemas/registry.ts` / R2 manifest `sha256:e7dcf9d90061a20c78c1286278afecfbd9295a769772b3f818f45aaa118ee60c` | `REV-HNS-CORE-003-TECH-002-05`; `REV-HNS-CORE-003-TECH-002-06`; both failed compilations left no public/Ajv residual state and valid same-ID retry succeeded | `MAJOR` | `RESOLVED` |

### Findings

- New findings: `None`.
- Accepted Risk References: `None`.

### Known Limitations and Scope Boundary

- The checked-in suite does not directly enforce semantic parity between all 12 JSON and TypeScript schema representations; this execution independently compared them and found zero mismatches.
- This evidence is only a `TECH_REVIEWER` decision. It does not perform QA, Security, any Gate, merge, release, or delivery assurance.
- `npm ci` and build created ignored `harness/node_modules/` and `harness/dist/` in the fresh temporary clone; neither is tracked or staged.

### Result

Reviewer decision: `PASS`.

`FIND-HNS-CORE-003-TECH-001` final status: `RESOLVED`.

GateResult: `N/A`; `IMPLEMENTATION_GATE` was not run.

### Integrity and Independence Validation

- [x] The review began from a fresh clone at the exact assigned HEAD and origin.
- [x] Both manifest hashes, exact lineage, all 45 inherited/replaced artifact identities, and post-candidate preparation isolation were independently validated.
- [x] Maker and Reviewer execution IDs are distinct and agree with the assigned Work Item, R2 manifest, and Maker evidence.
- [x] No implementation, test, schema, manifest, Work Item, package, governance, or other documentation file was modified by this Reviewer.
- [x] This execution appended only `docs/08_agent_reviews/review_log.md` and did not run QA, Security, any Gate, merge, or release action.
- [x] This PASS and Finding resolution remain bound to candidate `3b3040fed8aeec28b9afdb716c99cca24c89058e` and manifest hash `e7dcf9d90061a20c78c1286278afecfbd9295a769772b3f818f45aaa118ee60c`; any candidate artifact change invalidates them.

- Backward Compatibility: `N/A` for Reviewer; default and focused CORE-001/002 regression suites passed.

### Findings

- New findings: `None`.
- Prior finding: `FIND-HNS-CORE-003-TECH-001` independently reconfirmed as `RESOLVED` by both rollback retry regressions.
- Accepted Risk References: `None`.

### Known Limitations and Scope Boundary

- No lint script is defined; strict build/typecheck, `git diff --check`, test-marker scan, and scoped source scans passed.
- `npm ci` and build created ignored `harness/node_modules/` and `harness/dist/` in the fresh temporary clone; neither is tracked or staged.
- This evidence is only a `QA_REVIEWER` decision. It does not perform Security review, any Gate, merge, release, or Delivery Assurance.

### Result

Reviewer decision: `PASS`.

GateResult: `N/A`; `IMPLEMENTATION_GATE` was not run.

### Integrity and Independence Validation

- [x] The review began in a fresh temporary clone at the exact assigned origin, branch, and review-start HEAD.
- [x] Both manifest hashes, exact lineage, all 45 inherited/replaced artifact identities, and post-candidate isolation were independently validated.
- [x] Maker and Reviewer execution IDs are distinct and agree with the assigned Work Item, manifest, and Maker evidence.
- [x] The required latest TECH evidence is a `PASS` bound to the same R2 artifact hash, and the prior finding is `RESOLVED`.
- [x] This Reviewer did not modify implementation, tests, schemas, manifests, Work Items, packages, prior evidence, or finding closure.
- [x] This execution appended only `docs/08_agent_reviews/review_log.md` and did not run Security review, any Gate, merge, or release action.
- [x] This PASS remains bound to candidate `3b3040fed8aeec28b9afdb716c99cca24c89058e` and manifest hash `e7dcf9d90061a20c78c1286278afecfbd9295a769772b3f818f45aaa118ee60c`; any candidate artifact change invalidates it.

### Tests Performed

| Test Type | Command / Runner | Result | Evidence Reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| Environment | Pinned local toolchain; `node --version`; `npm --version` | `PASS` | Node `v24.19.0`; npm `11.17.0` |
| Clean Install | `npm ci`; repeated with `--foreground-scripts` | `PASS` | Added 7 packages; audited 8; 0 vulnerabilities; no lifecycle hook executed |
| Build | `npm run build` | `PASS` | `tsc --project tsconfig.json` completed |
| Typecheck | `npm run typecheck` | `PASS` | `tsc --project tsconfig.json --noEmit` completed |
| Default Unit / Smoke Test | `npm test` | `PASS` | 54 tests; 54 passed; 0 failed, cancelled, skipped, or todo |
| Dependency Audit | `npm audit --audit-level=high`; `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=high --json` | `PASS` | Full and production-only audits found 0 vulnerabilities at every severity |
| Dependency Resolution | `npm ls --all`; `npm explain ajv`; lock/metadata parser | `PASS` | Exact complete Ajv runtime tree; no missing/extraneous runtime package, alias, or unauthorized dependency |
| Registry Signature Check | `npm audit signatures` | `PASS` | 7 packages have verified registry signatures |
| Package Metadata / Provenance | `npm view`; `npm pack --ignore-scripts`; SHA-512; `git ls-remote` | `PASS` | Registry/lock/tarball identities match; npm `gitHead` equals upstream tag commit |
| Security Boundary Probe | Independent ESM Ajv class/dialect and rollback retry probe; production import/capability scans | `PASS` | Correct Ajv2020 semantics; 2/2 rollback cases recovered without validation weakening or new capability |
| Scope / Test Integrity | Manifest identity probe; commit path review; focused-marker scan; `git diff --check` | `PASS` | 45 identities matched; authorized scope only; no focused/skipped tests or whitespace errors |

### Implementer Scope Evidence

- Changed Files: `N/A` for Reviewer; independently verified R2 replaces only `harness/src/schemas/registry.ts` and `harness/tests/unit/schemas/registry.test.mjs` within the inherited 45-artifact set.
- Diff Scope: `N/A` for Reviewer; dependency commit changes only package/lock, discovery commit only the package test command, and R2 only rollback/test behavior.
- Unauthorized Change Check: `N/A` for Reviewer; no unauthorized dependency or production security-boundary capability was observed.
- Backward Compatibility: `N/A` for Reviewer; default suite, strict build/typecheck, canonical schema count, failed registration, successful retry, and invalid-value behavior all passed.

### Findings

- New findings: `None`.
- Prior finding: `FIND-HNS-CORE-003-TECH-001` remains `RESOLVED` and was independently reconfirmed by both rollback retry probes.
- Accepted Risk References: `None`.

### Known Limitations and Scope Boundary

- npm registry metadata had no published `dist.attestations` field for Ajv 8.20.0; package provenance was corroborated through verified registry signatures, exact tarball integrity, matching npm `gitHead`, and matching upstream `v8.20.0` tag. No risk was accepted.
- Ajv performs expected in-process validator code generation with `Function`; the reviewed project uses strict Ajv2020 compilation without remote `loadSchema`, custom keywords, filesystem, process, network, or persistence capability.
- Vulnerability and registry metadata checks are point-in-time evidence at `2026-08-26T07:42:57Z`.
- `npm ci` and build created ignored `harness/node_modules/` and `harness/dist/` in the fresh temporary clone; neither is tracked or staged.
- This evidence is only a `SECURITY_REVIEWER` decision. It does not run `IMPLEMENTATION_GATE`, merge, release, or Delivery Assurance.

### Result

Reviewer decision: `PASS`.

GateResult: `N/A`; `IMPLEMENTATION_GATE` was not run.

### Integrity and Independence Validation

- [x] The review began in a fresh temporary clone at the exact assigned origin, branch, and review-start HEAD.
- [x] Both manifest hashes, exact lineage, all 45 inherited/replaced artifact identities, and post-candidate isolation were independently validated.
- [x] Maker and Reviewer execution IDs are distinct and agree with the assigned Work Item, R2 manifest, and Maker evidence.
- [x] Current TECH and QA evidence are `PASS` decisions bound to the same R2 artifact hash; the prior finding is `RESOLVED`.
- [x] This Reviewer did not modify implementation, tests, schemas, manifests, Work Items, packages, prior evidence, or finding state.
- [x] This execution appended only `docs/08_agent_reviews/review_log.md` and did not run any Gate, merge, release, or Delivery Assurance action.
- [x] This PASS remains bound to candidate `3b3040fed8aeec28b9afdb716c99cca24c89058e` and manifest hash `e7dcf9d90061a20c78c1286278afecfbd9295a769772b3f818f45aaa118ee60c`; any candidate artifact change invalidates it.

### Gate Checks

| Check ID | Check | Evidence Reference | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| `IG-HNS-CORE-003-001-01` | Independent repository preflight | New temporary HTTPS clone; origin and assigned branch verified; local HEAD, remote branch, and refreshed `FETCH_HEAD` all equal expected gate-start SHA `492cb3579644c1dc8773028fa24fe6a0cb928417`; tracked worktree clean before evidence append | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-003-001-02` | Runtime preflight | Official `node-v24.19.0-darwin-arm64` archive SHA-256 `8294b7aa9b03997481c06babf1e8b270c859358f27da57a11509afe537ac381d` matched `SHASUMS256.txt`; authoritative commands used Node `v24.19.0` and npm `11.17.0` | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-003-001-03` | Exact lineage | Parent chain is linear: base `5ef3e18` -> companion preparation `49edddf` -> dependency `d9f65de` -> schema R1 `b147432` -> discovery / R1 `b12b416` -> R1 review preparation `4ebc01a` -> R1 TECH `f72b8ab` -> R2 `3b3040f` -> R2 preparation `97e6b4f` -> TECH `7b96417` -> QA `b258ca3` -> Security / gate-start `492cb35` | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-003-001-04` | Manifest integrity and inheritance | Recomputed R1 hash `2e4277a...dc58` and R2 hash `e7dcf9d...60c`; parsed R1 and R2 rows; verified 45 total artifacts, 43 inherited identities, 2 R2 replacements, and 0 Git blob or content SHA-256 mismatches at R1, R2, or gate-start HEAD | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-003-001-05` | Candidate identity and isolation | R2 commit changes only `harness/src/schemas/registry.ts` and `harness/tests/unit/schemas/registry.test.mjs`; all five post-candidate changed paths are the R2 manifest, canonical review log, and three R2 review Work Items; no reviewed artifact changed after R2 | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-003-001-06` | Maker evidence and separation | R1 Maker executions `IMP-HNS-CORE-003-DEPENDENCY-001`, `IMP-HNS-CORE-003-SCHEMAS-001`, and `IMP-HNS-CORE-003-TEST-DISCOVERY-001`, remediation Maker `IMP-HNS-CORE-003-REMEDIATION-R2-001`, TECH `REV-HNS-CORE-003-TECH-002-EXEC`, QA `REV-HNS-CORE-003-QA-002-EXEC`, Security `REV-HNS-CORE-003-SECURITY-002-EXEC`, and this gate execution are distinct; Maker evidence is `READY_FOR_REVIEW`, not approval | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-003-001-07` | Current TECH evidence | `REV-HNS-CORE-003-TECH-002` is the latest TECH decision, is `PASS`, binds candidate `3b3040f` and R2 hash `e7dcf9d...60c`, independently validates both rollback sequences, and records `FIND-HNS-CORE-003-TECH-001` as `RESOLVED` | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-003-001-08` | Current QA evidence | `REV-HNS-CORE-003-QA-002` is `PASS`, binds the same candidate/hash, depends on current TECH PASS, validates all primary/companion ACs and test discovery, and independently reconfirms the finding resolution | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-003-001-09` | Current Security evidence | Dependency trust and supply-chain state changed, so Security is required; `REV-HNS-CORE-003-SECURITY-002` is `PASS`, binds the same candidate/hash, verifies exact Ajv identity/integrity/tree/audit and Ajv2020 boundary, and adds no accepted risk | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-003-001-10` | Review commit isolation | R2 TECH, QA, and Security review commits each modify only `docs/08_agent_reviews/review_log.md`; the R2 preparation commit modifies only the R2 manifest, review log, and assigned review Work Items; no Reviewer modified the reviewed implementation | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-003-001-11` | Historical and stale evidence handling | R1 TECH `REV-HNS-CORE-003-TECH-001` is retained only as historical `REQUEST_CHANGES`; R1 QA and Security assignments remain unexecuted and have no evidence entries; none are used as PASS. Gate reliance is limited to the current R2 TECH/QA/Security PASS set | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-003-001-12` | Finding state | The append-only R1 `OPEN MAJOR` row is superseded by latest independent TECH closure in `REV-HNS-CORE-003-TECH-002`; QA and Security reconfirm closure; no current `OPEN BLOCKING` or `OPEN MAJOR` finding exists for R2 | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-003-001-13` | Canonical schema behavior | Gate runtime probe verified all 12 SDD schema IDs in order, exact resolution, duplicate rejection, distinct unknown schema/version fail-closed results, Work Item v1 migration-only response, v2 validation, 16 accountability cases, and 2 transactional same-ID retry regressions | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-003-001-14` | Schema artifact identity | Normalized local `$defs` / `$ref` expansion compared all 12 checked-in JSON artifacts with all 12 runtime TypeScript schema documents; 0 semantic mismatches | `PASS` |

| `IG-HNS-CORE-003-001-16` | Authorized implementation scope | Companion preparation changes only two companion Work Items; dependency commit only package/lock; schema commit only authorized schema/source/fixture/test paths; discovery commit only package test script; R2 only registry and its regression test; `git diff --check` passed | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-003-001-17` | Dependencies and SDD readiness | `HNS-CORE-001` and `HNS-CORE-002` are `DONE` with `IG-HNS-CORE-001-001` and `IG-HNS-CORE-002-001` Implementation Gate PASS. `REV-HNS-SDD-001` records independent Phase 1 readiness; current SDD differs from the reviewed bytes only by the approval-status/evidence metadata recorded with that PASS, with no normative body change | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-003-001-18` | GateResult separation and lifecycle boundary | Reviewer decisions remain distinct from this `GateResult`; this checker did not impersonate a Maker/Reviewer, modify candidate artifacts or prior evidence, update status, merge, release, or close lifecycle | `PASS` |

### Risk-Based Review Requirements

- `TECH_REVIEWER`: required and satisfied by current R2 `REV-HNS-CORE-003-TECH-002` with decision `PASS` on candidate `3b3040f` / manifest `e7dcf9d...60c`.
- `QA_REVIEWER`: required because the candidate changes validation behavior, acceptance fixtures, regression coverage, and default test discovery; satisfied by current R2 `REV-HNS-CORE-003-QA-002` with decision `PASS` on the same candidate/hash.
- `SECURITY_REVIEWER`: required because the exact Ajv runtime dependency changes dependency trust and supply-chain state; satisfied by current R2 `REV-HNS-CORE-003-SECURITY-002` with decision `PASS` on the same candidate/hash.

### Historical and Stale Evidence

- R1 `REV-HNS-CORE-003-TECH-001` is historical `REQUEST_CHANGES` evidence bound to R1 hash `2e4277a...dc58`; it is not a PASS basis.
- R1 assignments `HNS-CORE-003-QA-REVIEW-001` and `HNS-CORE-003-SECURITY-REVIEW-001` are stale after R2 and were never executed; no `REV-HNS-CORE-003-QA-001` or `REV-HNS-CORE-003-SECURITY-001` evidence exists.
- The gate relies only on R2 Maker evidence, current R2 TECH/QA/Security PASS evidence, exact R2 artifact identity, and this independent gate rerun. No stale PASS is used.

### Findings

No unresolved `OPEN BLOCKING` or `OPEN MAJOR` finding remains for the R2 candidate.

| Finding | Severity | Final Status | Closure Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FIND-HNS-CORE-003-TECH-001` | `MAJOR` | `RESOLVED` | Latest independent TECH `REV-HNS-CORE-003-TECH-002-05` and `-06`; QA and Security independently reconfirmed rollback retry behavior. |

### Status and Scope Boundary

- Changed by this gate execution: append-only gate evidence in `docs/08_agent_reviews/review_log.md`.
- Not changed: implementation, tests, schemas, manifests, Work Items, package/lock, governance, prior evidence, finding state, or lifecycle status.
- No merge, release, Delivery Assurance, lifecycle closure, or force push was performed.

### Result

GateResult: `PASS`.

### Review, Security, and Finding Closure

- `REV-HNS-CORE-003-TECH-001` remains historical `REQUEST_CHANGES`; its execution Work Item is complete.
- `FIND-HNS-CORE-003-TECH-001` is `RESOLVED` by `REV-HNS-CORE-003-TECH-002` against the R2 manifest.
- `REV-HNS-CORE-003-QA-002` and `REV-HNS-CORE-003-SECURITY-002` independently passed against the same R2 manifest hash.
- Security review was required and satisfied because exact `ajv@8.20.0` introduced a dependency-trust change. No accepted risk was used.
- No unresolved `OPEN BLOCKING` or `OPEN MAJOR` finding remains.

### Lifecycle Closure

| Work Item | Final Status | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `HNS-CORE-003` | `DONE` | Implementation Gate and post-merge validation passed. |
| `HNS-CORE-003-DEPENDENCY-AJV` | `DONE` | Exact dependency and supply-chain review passed. |
| `HNS-CORE-003-TEST-DISCOVERY` | `DONE` | Default test discovery verified. |
| `HNS-CORE-003-TECH-REVIEW-001` | `DONE` | Executed with `REQUEST_CHANGES`; evidence retained. |
| `HNS-CORE-003-TECH-REVIEW-002` | `DONE` | Executed with `PASS`; Finding resolved. |
| `HNS-CORE-003-QA-REVIEW-001` | `CANCELLED` | Never executed; R1 assignment became stale after remediation. |
| `HNS-CORE-003-QA-REVIEW-002` | `DONE` | Executed with `PASS`. |
| `HNS-CORE-003-SECURITY-REVIEW-001` | `CANCELLED` | Never executed; R1 assignment became stale after remediation. |

### Checks and Tests

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Error implementation scope | `PASS` | Five `src/errors` modules and two `tests/unit/errors` files only across the Maker implementation/self-review commits. |
| Test discovery scope | `PASS` | `harness/package.json` only; no lockfile, dependency, framework, source, or test change. |
| Catalog and exit contracts | `PASS` | Exactly 30 Section 33 rows and central 0-8 Section 34 registry; duplicate, unknown, missing, and ad-hoc override cases fail closed. |
| HarnessError boundary | `PASS` | Typed immutable error/cause/details, source/result isolation, nested redaction, unsafe-message rejection before Error construction, and sentinel-safe serialization. |
| Build / typecheck | `PASS` | Strict TypeScript build and no-emit typecheck under the required runtime. |
| Default tests | `PASS` | 94 discovered tests passed; 0 failed, cancelled, skipped, or todo; count is evidence only. |
| Security check | `PASS` | `npm audit --audit-level=high` found 0 vulnerabilities; no dependency change. |
| Capability / scope scan | `PASS` | No process exit, CLI, runtime, adapter, filesystem/network capability, vendor import, broad `any`, or HNS-CORE-005 implementation. |

### Acceptance Criteria Self Review

- `AC-HNS-CORE-004-001`: `PASS` in Maker self-review; every Section 33 code has exactly one Section 34 mapping.
- `AC-HNS-CORE-004-002`: `PASS` in Maker self-review; duplicate, unknown, missing-catalog, missing-registry, and out-of-range cases fail closed.
- `AC-HNS-CORE-004-003`: `PASS` in Maker self-review; details and typed causes are immutable/redacted, raw causes are rejected, and synthetic secrets are absent from final outputs.
- `AC-HNS-CORE-004-004`: `PASS` in Maker self-review; caller exit-code override is compile-time impossible and runtime rejected.
- Test discovery companion ACs: `PASS` in Maker self-review; root, core, schema, and error suites are discovered by default.

### Result

`READY_FOR_REVIEW`

This is Maker Role Completion Evidence only. It is not TECH, QA, Security, or Gate approval and does not close any Finding or Work Item.

### Commit Scope Validation

| Commit | Scope | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `a78ab0b...` | Added only `work-items/HNS-CORE-004-TEST-DISCOVERY.md`. | `PASS` |
| `449a24c...` | Added only five `harness/src/errors/**` modules and two `harness/tests/unit/errors/**` files. | `PASS` |
| `b56bf10...` | Modified only `harness-error.ts`, `safe-details.ts`, and `errors.test.mjs`. | `PASS` |
| `091307f...` | Modified only `harness/package.json` test discovery. | `PASS` |
| `0ab11af...` | Added the immutable manifest and independent-review control artifacts; modified prior Maker evidence only. No reviewed artifact changed. | `PASS` |

No dependency or lockfile drift, CLI/runtime/adapter/vendor/HNS-CORE-005 scope, filesystem/network capability, `process.exit`, or broad `any` was found in the candidate scope.

### Commands

| Command | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `npm ci` | `PASS` | 7 packages added; 0 vulnerabilities. |
| `npm run build` | `PASS` | Strict TypeScript build completed. |
| `npm run typecheck` | `PASS` | No-emit strict typecheck completed. |
| `npm test` | `PASS` | 94 passed; 0 failed, cancelled, skipped, or todo. |
| `npm audit --audit-level=high` | `PASS` | 0 vulnerabilities. |
| Static skip / todo / only scan | `PASS` | No `test/it/describe.skip`, `.todo`, `.only`, or option-form skip/todo/only found. |
| Static production-boundary scans | `PASS` | No forbidden capability/import, broad `any`, dependency/lockfile drift, or unauthorized candidate path found. |

Default discovery includes root, core, schema, and error globs. The current tree contains 1 root test file, 1 core test file, 5 schema test files, and 1 error test file; the official default run executed all four groups.

### Independent Probes

| Probe | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| SDD-derived catalog and exit comparison | `PASS` | Parsed Sections 33 and 34 independently: exactly 30 catalog rows and 9 exit definitions matched every exported field and mapping. |
| Registry fail-closed behavior | `PASS` | Duplicate, unknown, missing, non-integer, and out-of-range catalog/exit inputs rejected; no Generic fallback was observed. |
| Central-only exit contract | `PASS` | Every constructed error derived its exit from the catalog; runtime caller override rejected. An independent TypeScript compile probe rejected the option override, readonly assignment, and raw `Error` cause. |
| Typed immutable error contract | `PASS` | Authentic typed causes accepted; raw/forged causes rejected; instances, recursive details, cause chain, and serialized snapshots frozen. |
| Details behavior | `PASS` | Source/result isolation, preserved shared identity, circular object/array rejection, accessor rejection with zero getter reads, dense-array enforcement, and six non-plain value classes verified. |
| Representative redaction/message safety | `PASS` | 29 canonical case, camel, snake, hyphen, and compact variants redacted; unsafe `Authorization` message rejected before `HarnessError` construction; safe custom message preserved; sentinel absent from the accepted typed cause chain and serialized output. |
| Determinism | `PASS` | Repeated construction and serialization produced equal JSON with isolated frozen result objects. |
| Delimiter-free lowercase marker boundary | `FAIL` | `tokenvalue`, `authorizationvalue`, `passwordhash`, `clientsecret`, `servicecredential`, and `sessioncookie` bypassed details redaction and custom-message rejection. The sentinel reached details JSON and accepted error message, stack, and JSON. |

### Findings

#### FND-HNS-CORE-004-TECH-001-001 - Delimiter-free sensitive marker variants leak secret values

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Finding ID | `FND-HNS-CORE-004-TECH-001-001` |
| Severity | `MAJOR` |
| Owner | `IMPLEMENTER` |
| Status | `OPEN` |
| Affected Requirements | `AC-HNS-CORE-004-003`; `AC-HNS-CORE-004-TECH-REVIEW-001-003` |
| Evidence | `harness/src/errors/safe-details.ts:38-50`, `harness/src/errors/safe-details.ts:130-132`, `harness/src/errors/harness-error.ts:106-110`; independent sentinel bypass probe. |
| Action | Expand sensitive-marker normalization/detection so delimiter-free lowercase compounds containing the canonical token, authorization, password, secret, credential, and cookie markers cannot bypass details redaction or custom-message rejection. Add focused regression coverage, issue a new candidate/manifest hash, and obtain a new independent review. |

The detector recognizes exact marker words and only three compact compounds (`apikey`, `accesstoken`, `refreshtoken`). Other plausible delimiter-free lowercase variants are treated as safe. This permits raw values to enter immutable details and permits accepted custom messages to place the same value in message, stack, and JSON, violating the redaction and unsafe-message boundary.

### Scope and Limitations

- Reviewer write scope was limited to this append in `docs/08_agent_reviews/review_log.md`; no reviewed artifact, manifest, Work Item, governance file, prior evidence, status, harness source/test, or candidate commit was modified.
- This is `TECH_REVIEWER` evidence only. It does not act as QA, Security, Gate Checker, merger, or lifecycle closer.
- Checked-in tests were run but were not trusted as the sole evidence; independent SDD-derived runtime, compile-time, boundary, provenance, hash, and static probes were used.

### Decision

`REQUEST_CHANGES`

The implementation and candidate identities are valid and all official commands pass, but `FND-HNS-CORE-004-TECH-001-001` remains `OPEN`. The redaction/message-safety acceptance criterion is therefore not satisfied for the reviewed manifest hash.

| Finding reproduction before R2 | `PASS` | Six compact variants bypassed details/message checks under R1 as independently recorded by TECH-001. |
| Compact-marker closure in Maker self-review | `PASS` | Shared normalization detects canonical fragments inside delimiter-free compounds for details and custom messages. |
| Sentinel containment | `PASS` | All six variants redact details, reject unsafe messages without echoing input, and exclude sentinel from message, stack, typed cause, and JSON. |
| Safe behavior regression | `PASS` | Safe custom message, canonical 30-row catalog, 0-8 registry, immutable typed causes/details, and prior tests remain unchanged. |
| Build / typecheck | `PASS` | Strict build and no-emit typecheck completed. |
| Default tests | `PASS` | 96 discovered tests passed; 0 failed, cancelled, skipped, or todo; count is evidence only. |
| Security check | `PASS` | `npm audit --audit-level=high` found 0 vulnerabilities; no dependency change. |

### Result

`READY_FOR_REVIEW`

This is Maker remediation evidence only. It does not resolve the Finding, approve TECH/QA/Security, pass a Gate, merge, or close lifecycle.

### Canonical Basis

- Loaded `.ai/CONSTITUTION.md`, `.ai/AUTHORITY.md`, `.ai/WORKFLOW.md`, the canonical `REVIEWER` role, the assigned `TECH_REVIEWER` profile, `HNS-CORE-004-TECH-REVIEW-002`, and `IMPLEMENTATION_GATE`.
- Reviewed SDD Sections 33, 34, 40.1, and 46 Phase 1; both immutable manifests; R2 Maker evidence; R1 TECH evidence and Finding; `HNS-CORE-004`; `HNS-CORE-004-TEST-DISCOVERY`; and all nine reviewed artifacts.
- Validated `AC-HNS-CORE-004-001` through `AC-HNS-CORE-004-004`, all five Test Discovery companion ACs, and all four assigned R2 TECH review ACs.

### Provenance and Identity Validation

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Fresh clone and exact origin | `PASS` | New clone under `/private/tmp/hns-core-004-tech-r2.rlC9Wt/repo`; fetch and push URLs both exactly `https://github.com/ivan-tsai1207/ai-system-delivery-framework.git`. |
| Branch and refreshed HEAD | `PASS` | Local branch `feature/hns-core-004-error-registry`; local HEAD, fetched remote-tracking ref, and `git ls-remote` all resolved to `be601009ee9b5f910cacb904bacc5eb57035355b` before review evidence was written. |
| Clean starting tree and pinned runtime | `PASS` | Starting `git status --porcelain=v1` was empty; assigned PATH resolved Node `v24.19.0` and npm `11.17.0`. |
| Manifest integrity | `PASS` | Independent SHA-256 calculation matched R1 `3c7289da...` and R2 `d9bee8dc...` exactly. |
| R2 inheritance and replacement set | `PASS` | Seven artifact blobs and content hashes are unchanged from R1; only `safe-details.ts` and `errors.test.mjs` have the two exact R2 replacement identities. |
| Candidate lineage | `PASS` | Base through R1 is a direct-parent chain; R1 candidate is an ancestor of R2 candidate; remediation commit `8541d2b...` has sole parent `9a6428b...`; review-start HEAD `be60100...` has sole parent `8541d2b...`. |
| R2 commit scope | `PASS` | `8541d2b...` changes only the two declared replacements. |
| Post-candidate artifact immutability | `PASS` | All nine reviewed blobs are identical at R2 candidate, review-start HEAD, and worktree; candidate-to-HEAD changes are control-plane review artifacts only. |
| Execution separation | `PASS` | `REV-HNS-CORE-004-TECH-002-EXEC` was absent before this append and is distinct from R1 Reviewer and every R1/R2 Maker execution ID. |

### Commands

| Command | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `npm ci` | `PASS` | 7 packages added; 8 audited; 0 vulnerabilities. |
| `npm run build` | `PASS` | Strict TypeScript build completed under the pinned runtime. |
| `npm run typecheck` | `PASS` | No-emit strict typecheck completed. |
| `npm test` | `PASS` | 96 passed; 0 failed, cancelled, skipped, or todo. |
| `npm audit --audit-level=high` | `PASS` | 0 vulnerabilities. |
| Static skip / todo / only scan | `PASS` | 0 suppression matches in `harness/tests`. |
| Static production capability scan | `PASS` | 0 `process.exit`/exit override, process-control, filesystem, network, child-process, worker, or external transport matches in `harness/src/errors`. |
| Static type/dependency/scope scans | `PASS` | 0 broad `any`; production imports are internal only; no dependency or lockfile change; the package delta only adds error-test discovery; no unauthorized candidate path. |

Default discovery contains 1 root test file, 1 core test file, 5 schema test files, and 1 error test file. The official default command executed all four groups.

### Independent Probes

| Probe | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Exact R1 six-variant reproduction | `PASS` | At `091307f...`, neutral sentinel `ULTRAVIOLET_9F8E7D6C` leaked for each of `tokenvalue`, `authorizationvalue`, `passwordhash`, `clientsecret`, `servicecredential`, and `sessioncookie` through details, accepted custom message, stack, typed-cause JSON, and outer JSON. This independently reproduced the R1 Finding without relying on a value containing a sensitive marker. |
| R2 compact-marker closure | `PASS` | For all six variants, details equal `[REDACTED]`; source order and runtime behavior confirm unsafe custom messages reject in option parsing before `super(...)` / `Error` construction, with a generic `TypeError` that does not echo input. |
| R2 sentinel containment and safe-message regression | `PASS` | The same neutral sentinel is absent from message, stack, typed cause, cause JSON, rejection JSON, and safe outer JSON; `Runtime operation failed safely.` is retained exactly. |
| SDD-derived catalog and exit comparison | `PASS` | Parsed Sections 33 and 34 independently and compared exports field by field: exactly 30 ordered catalog rows with exact metadata/mappings and exactly nine exit definitions, 0 through 8. |
| Fail-closed registry behavior | `PASS` | Duplicate, unknown, and missing catalog codes; duplicate, missing, unknown, non-integer, and out-of-range exit definitions; missing mappings; and unknown lookups all rejected. No catalog entry maps to Generic exit 1 and no fallback was observed. |
| Central exit and independent compile contract | `PASS` | Runtime exit override rejected. A temporary independent TypeScript fixture produced exactly expected `TS2353`, `TS2540`, and `TS2740` diagnostics for option override, readonly assignment, and raw `Error` cause, then was removed. |
| Typed cause authenticity | `PASS` | Authentic `HarnessError` cause accepted by identity; raw `Error` and forged-prototype causes rejected. |
| Immutability, isolation, and graph behavior | `PASS` | Error, catalog, registry, recursive details, causes, and serialized snapshots are frozen; source/result and repeated serialization are isolated; shared identity is preserved; circular object/array, accessor with zero getter reads, and six non-plain classes fail closed; null-prototype plain input is accepted. |
| Deterministic output | `PASS` | Repeated construction and serialization produced byte-equal JSON with independent frozen snapshots. |
| Default test discovery | `PASS` | Package script contains root/core/schema/error globs and the independent filesystem count matched 1/1/5/1. |

### Finding Closure

#### FND-HNS-CORE-004-TECH-001-001 - Delimiter-free sensitive marker variants leak secret values

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Finding ID | `FND-HNS-CORE-004-TECH-001-001` |
| Severity | `MAJOR` |
| Previous Status | `OPEN` |
| Latest Status | `RESOLVED` |
| Closure Candidate | `8541d2b192392885c1d033cb5f05992c1b37a0d6` |
| Closure Manifest / Hash | `docs/08_agent_reviews/manifests/HNS-CORE-004-implementation-r2.md` / `d9bee8dc562467809ae8a996d805250c3276d954d81a536e35987f3abbbee2ec` |
| Closure Evidence | Exact R1 reproduction plus independent neutral-sentinel R2 checks for all six variants; complete regression, SDD-derived, static, runtime, and compile probes passed. |

The remediation applies one normalized canonical-marker detector to both detail-key redaction and custom-message rejection. The original bypass is closed on the exact R2 artifact identity without changing the catalog, exit behavior, cause contract, or authorized capability boundary.

### Findings

No new findings.

### Scope and Limitations

- Reviewer write scope is limited to this append in `docs/08_agent_reviews/review_log.md`; no reviewed artifact, manifest, harness file, Work Item, governance file, prior evidence, or prior status was modified.
- This execution did not repair implementation and is independent from R1 Reviewer and every Maker execution.
- This is `TECH_REVIEWER` evidence only. It does not act as QA, Security, Gate Checker, merger, release authority, or lifecycle closer.
- Checked-in tests were not trusted as sole evidence; exact R1 reproduction and independent SDD-derived runtime, compile, provenance, hash, scope, and boundary probes were also executed.

### Decision

`PASS`

All assigned R2 technical acceptance criteria are satisfied for manifest SHA-256 `d9bee8dc562467809ae8a996d805250c3276d954d81a536e35987f3abbbee2ec` and candidate `8541d2b192392885c1d033cb5f05992c1b37a0d6`. `FND-HNS-CORE-004-TECH-001-001` is independently closed as `RESOLVED`.

### Acceptance Criteria Results

| Acceptance Criterion | Result | Independent Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `AC-HNS-CORE-004-001` | `PASS` | SDD-derived parser found exactly 30 Section 33 rows and matched every code, name/default message, retryable value, human action, lifecycle mapping, and Section 34 exit mapping. |

| `AC-HNS-CORE-004-QA-REVIEW-002-004` | `PASS` | Root/core/schema/error default discovery and focused regression passed with zero failed/skipped/todo/focused tests. |

### Commands and Regression

| Command / Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `npm ci` | `PASS` | 7 packages added; 8 audited; 0 vulnerabilities. |
| `npm run build` | `PASS` | Strict TypeScript build completed under the pinned runtime. |
| `npm run typecheck` | `PASS` | No-emit strict typecheck completed. |
| `npm test` | `PASS` | 96 passed; 0 failed, cancelled, skipped, or todo. |
| `npm audit --audit-level=high` | `PASS` | 0 vulnerabilities. |
| `node --test tests/*.test.mjs` | `PASS` | Root: 3 passed; 0 failed/skipped/todo. |
| `node --test tests/unit/core/*.test.mjs` | `PASS` | CORE-001 regression: 13 passed; 0 failed/skipped/todo. |
| `node --test tests/unit/schemas/*.test.mjs` | `PASS` | CORE-002/003 schema regression: 38 passed; 0 failed/skipped/todo. |

| Static skip/todo/only scan | `PASS` | 0 `test`/`it`/`describe` skip, todo, or only declarations/options in `harness/tests`. |
| Static capability/type/import scan | `PASS` | 0 `process.exit`/`process.exitCode`, forbidden runtime imports/transports, external imports, or broad `any` in `harness/src/errors`. |
| Dependency and scope scan | `PASS` | No lockfile/dependency change; package delta only adds error test discovery; R2 remediation commit changes only its two declared paths. |

### Independent Acceptance Probes

| Probe | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| SDD-derived catalog/exit matrix | `PASS` | Parsed canonical Sections 33 and 34 at runtime, independently of checked-in expected arrays: exactly 30 ordered catalog rows and 9 ordered exit definitions matched every exported field. |
| Registry integrity and fail-closed behavior | `PASS` | Ten negative integrity/lookup cases covered duplicate, unknown, missing, unmapped, non-integer, and out-of-range inputs; no exit-1 fallback was observed. |
| Central exit compile/runtime contract | `PASS` | Runtime caller override rejected. An ephemeral external TypeScript fixture produced `TS2353`, `TS2540`, and `TS2740` for override, readonly assignment, and raw cause, then was removed. |
| Authentic typed causes | `PASS` | Authentic `HarnessError` cause accepted by identity; raw `Error` and forged-prototype causes rejected. Nested typed causes retained canonical exit mappings. |
| Immutability, isolation, and determinism | `PASS` | Instances, recursive details, shared references, causes, and repeated serialized snapshots are frozen; source/result mutations are isolated; repeated construction and serialization are byte-equal. |
| Unsafe detail shapes | `PASS` | Sixteen independent cases covered circular object/array, zero-read accessor, sparse array, six non-plain classes, non-finite numbers, and non-JSON primitive values; all failed closed. |
| Canonical and compact marker safety | `PASS` | Sixteen marker forms, including exact prior bypasses `tokenvalue`, `authorizationvalue`, `passwordhash`, `clientsecret`, `servicecredential`, and `sessioncookie`, redacted details and rejected unsafe custom messages. |
| Neutral sentinel containment | `PASS` | `ULTRAVIOLET_9F8E7D6C` was absent from details, message, stack, typed cause chain, rejection JSON, cause JSON, and outer JSON for every marker case. |
| Safe custom message | `PASS` | `Runtime operation failed safely.` was preserved exactly with canonical metadata and central exit mapping unchanged. |
| Default discovery and regression | `PASS` | Root, CORE-001, CORE-002/003 schema, and error groups all executed in default and focused runs with no suppressions. |

### Findings

No new findings. Prior `FND-HNS-CORE-004-TECH-001-001` remains `RESOLVED` on the reviewed R2 candidate/hash.

### Scope and Limitations

- Reviewer write scope is limited to this append in `docs/08_agent_reviews/review_log.md`; no reviewed artifact, manifest, Work Item/status, governance file, prior evidence, or prior finding state was modified.
- This execution did not repair implementation and is independent from all Maker and TECH executions.
- This is `QA_REVIEWER` evidence only. It does not act as TECH, Security, Gate Checker, merger, release authority, or lifecycle closer.
- Checked-in tests were not trusted as sole evidence; independent SDD-derived, runtime, compile, provenance, identity, scope, marker, sentinel, immutability, isolation, and deterministic probes were also executed.

| Timestamp | `2026-08-26T13:43:00Z` |

### Trigger Calculation

| Security Trigger | Candidate State | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Authentication or authorization behavior | None | `NOT_TRIGGERED` |
| Permission enforcement | None; only error metadata names are represented | `NOT_TRIGGERED` |
| Credential or secret source | None; no credential lookup, storage, injection, transport, or real secret fixture | `NOT_TRIGGERED` |
| Sensitive-data persistence or external write | None; pure in-memory snapshots only | `NOT_TRIGGERED` |
| Filesystem, network, process, command, or environment boundary | None | `NOT_TRIGGERED` |
| New dependency or dependency-trust change | None; package lock and dependency graph unchanged | `NOT_TRIGGERED` |
| Production or destructive operation | None | `NOT_TRIGGERED` |
| Security boundary expansion | None; the candidate narrows output by fail-closed redaction and rejects raw causes/messages | `NOT_TRIGGERED` |

### Rationale

- The candidate implements deterministic in-memory error metadata, immutable snapshots, typed cause validation, and output redaction only.
- It never reads a credential source, handles authentication, enforces permission, stores real secrets, performs external I/O, adds a dependency, or changes a production/security execution boundary.
- Synthetic sentinel values are test inputs only. Current independent TECH and QA executions validated canonical and compact marker redaction, unsafe-message rejection, typed-cause containment, and absence from message, stack, cause, details, and JSON.
- `NOT_REQUIRED` is a risk-routing decision, not a Security review PASS and not `ACCEPTED_RISK`. If the candidate changes to add credential handling, external secret sources, dependency trust, auth, permission enforcement, I/O, or another security boundary, this decision becomes stale and a new `SECURITY_REVIEWER` execution is required.

### Decision

`SECURITY_REVIEWER = NOT_REQUIRED`

### Gate Checks

| Check ID | Check | Evidence Reference | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| `IG-HNS-CORE-004-001-01` | Independent repository preflight | Fresh temporary HTTPS clone; origin exactly matches the assigned repository; local branch, refreshed remote-tracking ref, `FETCH_HEAD`, and live remote tip equal expected gate-start `d0f3f733...`; tracked tree was clean | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-004-001-02` | Runtime preflight | Assigned PATH resolves the supplied Node and npm binaries; versions are exactly Node `v24.19.0` and npm `11.17.0` | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-004-001-03` | Complete direct-parent lineage | Linear sole-parent chain verified from base `977a90f` through preparation `a78ab0b`, implementation `449a24c`, self-review fix `b56bf10`, R1 candidate `091307f`, R1 review preparation `0ab11af`, R1 TECH `9a6428b`, R2 candidate `8541d2b`, R2 preparation `be60100`, TECH `6cac78d`, QA `535f7e4`, and gate-start/security calculation `d0f3f73` | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-004-001-04` | Manifest integrity and inheritance | Recomputed R1 SHA-256 `3c7289da...38d5a` and R2 SHA-256 `d9bee8dc...e2ec`; all nine R2 artifact identities match; seven are inherited exactly and only two are authoritative R2 replacements | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-004-001-05` | Candidate identity and post-candidate immutability | R2 changes only `safe-details.ts` and `errors.test.mjs`; candidate-to-gate-start changes are only the R2 manifest, review log, and two R2 review Work Items; all nine reviewed blobs are unchanged after `8541d2b` | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-004-001-06` | Maker / TECH / QA / Gate separation | R1 Makers, R2 remediation Maker, R1 and R2 TECH executions, R2 QA execution, and `IG-HNS-CORE-004-001-EXEC` are all distinct; this Gate execution ID was absent before this append; no Checker modified reviewed artifacts | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-004-001-07` | Maker evidence | R1 and R2 Maker evidence are `READY_FOR_REVIEW` records with exact candidate/hash/scope bindings and do not claim Reviewer or Gate approval | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-004-001-08` | Current TECH evidence | Latest TECH evidence is `REV-HNS-CORE-004-TECH-002`, decision `PASS`, bound to R2 candidate `8541d2b...` and manifest hash `d9bee8dc...`; commit changes only the review log | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-004-001-09` | Current QA evidence | `REV-HNS-CORE-004-QA-002` is `PASS`, depends on current TECH PASS, binds the same R2 candidate/hash, validates every primary and companion AC, and its commit changes only the review log | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-004-001-10` | Security review requirement | Independent canonical trigger calculation confirms pure in-memory metadata, immutable snapshots, typed causes, and redaction only; no auth, permission enforcement, credential source, real secret storage, external I/O, new dependency/trust, destructive, production, or expanded security boundary exists; `SECURITY_REVIEWER = NOT_REQUIRED` is valid and is neither Security PASS nor Accepted Risk | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-004-001-11` | Historical and stale evidence handling | R1 `REV-HNS-CORE-004-TECH-001` remains historical `REQUEST_CHANGES`; `HNS-CORE-004-QA-REVIEW-001` was never executed and no QA-001 evidence exists; neither is used as a current PASS basis | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-004-001-12` | Finding state | `FND-HNS-CORE-004-TECH-001-001` history retains `OPEN MAJOR`, but its latest independent state is `RESOLVED` on the exact R2 candidate/hash; no current `OPEN BLOCKING` or `OPEN MAJOR` finding remains | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-004-001-13` | Canonical catalog and exit registry | Independent SDD parser compared runtime exports field by field: exactly 30 ordered Section 33 rows and exactly nine Section 34 definitions, exit codes `0..8`; duplicate, unknown, missing, unmapped, non-integer, and out-of-range cases fail closed with no Generic fallback | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-004-001-14` | Redaction, cause, immutability, and central exit | Gate probe validates recursive redaction, all six compact-marker closures, neutral-sentinel containment, safe custom message retention, authentic typed immutable causes, raw/forged cause rejection, frozen isolated snapshots, compile/runtime exit override rejection, and central-only exit derivation | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-004-001-15` | Default discovery and regression | Default runner discovers root, core, schema, and error groups; full run passes 96/96 and focused runs pass `3/3`, `13/13`, `38/38`, and `42/42`, all with zero failed, cancelled, skipped, todo, or focused declarations | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-004-001-16` | Authorized scope and capability boundary | Exact commit scopes match the primary and companion Work Items; no dependency/lock drift, CLI, adapter, execution/runtime, process exit, filesystem/network/process capability, external import, broad `any`, governance/spec change, or HNS-CORE-005 implementation exists in the reviewed candidate | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-004-001-17` | Dependency and SDD readiness | `HNS-CORE-001` and `HNS-CORE-002` are `DONE` with Implementation Gate PASS; `REV-HNS-SDD-001` records independent Phase 1 readiness and the current SDD differs from reviewed bytes only by approval metadata, not normative content | `PASS` |
| `IG-HNS-CORE-004-001-18` | GateResult and lifecycle boundary | Reviewer decisions remain separate from this `GateResult`; this checker did not modify implementation, manifests, Work Items/statuses, prior evidence/finding state, merge, release, lifecycle, `main`, or CORE-005 | `PASS` |

### Review and Security Requirements

- `TECH_REVIEWER`: satisfied by current R2 `REV-HNS-CORE-004-TECH-002` `PASS` on candidate `8541d2b...` / manifest `d9bee8dc...`.
- `QA_REVIEWER`: satisfied by current R2 `REV-HNS-CORE-004-QA-002` `PASS` on the same candidate/hash after TECH-002.
- `SECURITY_REVIEWER`: independently confirmed `NOT_REQUIRED` under canonical risk policy. The candidate only performs pure in-memory redaction/immutable error modeling and introduces no security trigger or Accepted Risk.

### Historical Evidence and Findings

- R1 `REV-HNS-CORE-004-TECH-001` is retained as historical `REQUEST_CHANGES` evidence on R1 hash `3c7289da...`; it is not a PASS basis.
- R1 `HNS-CORE-004-QA-REVIEW-001` was never executed; no `REV-HNS-CORE-004-QA-001` evidence exists or is used.
- `FND-HNS-CORE-004-TECH-001-001` is latest `RESOLVED` by independent TECH-002 on the exact R2 candidate/hash; QA-002 reconfirms closure. No current `OPEN BLOCKING` or `OPEN MAJOR` finding remains.

### Status and Scope Boundary

- Changed by this Gate execution: append-only `IG-HNS-CORE-004-001` evidence in `docs/08_agent_reviews/review_log.md`.
- Not changed: implementation, tests, manifests, Work Items/statuses, prior evidence, finding history/state, dependencies, governance, SDD, lifecycle, `main`, or CORE-005.
- No merge, release, Delivery Assurance, lifecycle closure, force push, or work-item status transition was performed.

### Result

GateResult: `PASS`.

### Review, Security, and Finding Closure

- R1 `REV-HNS-CORE-004-TECH-001` remains historical `REQUEST_CHANGES`; its execution Work Item is complete.
- `FND-HNS-CORE-004-TECH-001-001` is latest `RESOLVED` by `REV-HNS-CORE-004-TECH-002` against the R2 candidate/hash.
- `REV-HNS-CORE-004-QA-002` independently passed against the same R2 candidate/hash and reconfirmed finding closure.
- Security review was independently calculated as `NOT_REQUIRED`: the candidate is pure in-memory redaction/error metadata with no auth, permission enforcement, credential source/storage, external I/O, dependency trust change, production boundary, or Accepted Risk.
- No unresolved `OPEN BLOCKING` or `OPEN MAJOR` finding remains.

### Lifecycle Closure

| `HNS-CORE-004` | `DONE` | Implementation Gate and post-merge validation passed. |
| `HNS-CORE-004-TEST-DISCOVERY` | `DONE` | Default root/core/schema/error discovery verified. |
| `HNS-CORE-004-TECH-REVIEW-001` | `DONE` | Executed with `REQUEST_CHANGES`; historical evidence retained. |
| `HNS-CORE-004-TECH-REVIEW-002` | `DONE` | Executed with `PASS`; Finding resolved. |
| `HNS-CORE-004-QA-REVIEW-001` | `CANCELLED` | Never executed; R1 assignment became stale after remediation. |
| `HNS-CORE-004-QA-REVIEW-002` | `DONE` | Executed with `PASS`. |

No Security Work Item was created because the independently validated requirement decision was `NOT_REQUIRED`.

This evidence records lifecycle and merge completion only. It is not a Reviewer decision, GateResult, release approval, merge to `main`, or authorization to start HNS-CORE-005.

### Checks and Tests

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Primary implementation scope | `PASS` | Thirteen hash/config source, test, and fixture files only; all are inside the primary Work Item Write Scope. |
| Test discovery scope | `PASS` | `harness/package.json` only; no lockfile, dependency, source, or test change. |
| Canonical hash contract | `PASS` | Unicode-normalized deterministic key ordering, path-independent canonical UTF-8 bytes, SHA-256 vectors, mismatch verification, unsupported-value rejection, and redacted diagnostics. |
| Config contract | `PASS` | Exact v1 validation, unknown/secret fail-closed checks, trusted-host merge followed by project/invocation narrowing, immutable snapshots, and explicit allowlist environment policy. |
| Build / typecheck | `PASS` | Strict TypeScript build and no-emit typecheck under the required runtime. |
| Focused tests | `PASS` | 30 hash/config tests passed; 0 failed. |
| Default tests | `PASS` | 126 discovered tests passed; 0 failed, cancelled, skipped, or todo; count is evidence only. |
| Security / dependency check | `PASS` | `npm audit --audit-level=high` found 0 vulnerabilities; no dependency or lockfile change. |
| Capability / scope scan | `PASS` | No Context/Policy compiler, audit store, runtime process, filesystem/network I/O, adapter, environment injection, or later-phase implementation. |

### Acceptance Criteria Self Review

- `AC-HNS-CORE-005-001`: `PASS` in Maker self-review; equivalent normalized values produce identical canonical bytes and SHA-256 independent of key ordering and fixture path.
- `AC-HNS-CORE-005-002`: `PASS` in Maker self-review; config precedence only narrows and unknown keys, secret-bearing keys/values, invalid versions, and denied environment names fail closed.
- `AC-HNS-CORE-005-003`: `PASS` in Maker self-review; Unicode/path independence, mismatch behavior, and redacted diagnostics are covered.
- `AC-HNS-CORE-005-004`: `PASS` in Maker self-review; no forbidden compiler, audit, runtime, adapter, I/O, or dependency behavior was introduced.
- Test discovery companion ACs: `PASS` in Maker self-review; root, core, schema, error, hash, and config suites are discovered by default.

### Result

`READY_FOR_REVIEW`

This is Maker Role Completion Evidence only. It is not TECH, QA, Security, or Gate approval and does not close any Finding or Work Item.

| Timestamp | `2026-08-27T00:48:51Z` |

### Provenance and Identity Validation

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Fresh clone and exact origin | `PASS` | Fresh clone at review start; fetch and push origin exactly `https://github.com/ivan-tsai1207/ai-system-delivery-framework.git`. |
| Branch and refreshed remote tip | `PASS` | Local HEAD and `git ls-remote` both resolved `feature/hns-core-005-config-hash` to `7d0b7c35d498b12ebf8c37e274985e6d42b3a694`. |
| Clean starting tree | `PASS` | `git status --short` was empty before review commands. |
| Independent execution identity | `PASS` | Reviewer execution/evidence IDs were absent from prior evidence and differ from both Maker execution IDs. |
| Candidate ancestry | `PASS` | `fb48e9c... -> efbe79d... -> 69cc152... -> 86aa33f... -> 7d0b7c3...` is a direct-parent chain. |
| Manifest integrity | `PASS` | Exact worktree bytes hash to the assigned SHA-256; manifest blob is `9cdc04af7ed9d23eafa9197800e6743695a05312`. |
| Artifact identity | `PASS` | All 15 manifest rows independently matched both the recorded Git blob and content SHA-256. |
| Post-candidate immutability | `PASS` | The diff after `86aa33f...` contains only review-preparation docs/evidence/Work Items; every reviewed artifact remains byte-identical. |

### Commit and Scope Validation

| Commit | Scope | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `efbe79d...` | Added only `work-items/HNS-CORE-005-TEST-DISCOVERY.md`. | `PASS` |
| `69cc152...` | Added only the 13 authorized hash/config source, test, and fixture files. | `PASS` |
| `86aa33f...` | Modified only `harness/package.json` test discovery. | `PASS` |
| `7d0b7c3...` | Added immutable manifest and independent-review control artifacts; appended Maker evidence. No reviewed artifact changed. | `PASS` |

`git diff --check` passed. No dependency or lockfile drift, Context/Policy compiler, audit store, runtime process, adapter, filesystem/network/process capability, later-phase module, focused/disabled test marker, or unauthorized candidate path was found.

### Commands

| Command | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `npm ci` | `PASS` | 7 packages added; 8 packages audited; 0 vulnerabilities. |
| `npm run build` | `PASS` | Strict TypeScript build completed. |
| `npm run typecheck` | `PASS` | No-emit strict typecheck completed. |
| `npm test` | `PASS` | 126 passed; 0 failed, cancelled, skipped, or todo. Root, core, schema, error, hash, and config suites were discovered. |
| Focused hash/config suites | `PASS` | 30 passed; 0 failed, cancelled, skipped, or todo. |
| `npm audit --audit-level=high` | `PASS` | 0 vulnerabilities. |

### Independent Adversarial Probes

| Probe | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| SHA-256 correctness | `PASS` | Independently matched Node `crypto` for random bytes at 17 boundary lengths from 0 through 4097 bytes, including 55/56/63/64/65-byte padding boundaries. |
| UTF-8 correctness | `PASS` | Matched `TextEncoder` for ASCII, composed/decomposed Unicode, BMP, astral, NUL/control, and malformed surrogate inputs. |
| Canonical serialization | `PASS` | Deterministic normalized keys/values, null-prototype values, shared references, ordering/path independence, negative zero, cycles, unsupported values, accessors, symbols, and normalized-key collisions behaved fail closed as required. |
| Hash mismatch diagnostics | `PASS` | Invalid expected hashes rejected; mismatch surfaces contained only expected/actual hashes and `[REDACTED]`, never the independent secret sentinel. |
| Config narrowing and immutability | `PASS` | Project/invocation re-expansion of visibility, adapters, environment, and numeric limits was rejected; source mutation did not alter frozen config/policy snapshots. |
| Unknown/accessor/key/env boundary | `PASS` | Unknown keys, accessor-backed config, secret-bearing object keys, and representative cloud/SSH/registry/production/token environment names rejected without getter execution. |
| Secret assignment marker boundary | `FAIL` | Allowed string fields retained obvious `api_key=`, `apikey=`, `authorization=`, `cookie=`, and `private_key=` query assignments with independent secret sentinels. |
| Agent-visible bearer credential boundary | `FAIL` | `CI_JOB_JWT` and `CI_JOB_JWT_V2` were accepted by config validation and emitted in the child Agent-visible allowlist. |

### Findings

#### FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-001-001 - Obvious secret assignment markers bypass config value rejection

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Finding ID | `FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-001-001` |
| Severity | `MAJOR` |
| Owner | `IMPLEMENTER` |
| Status | `OPEN` |
| Affected Requirements | `AC-HNS-CORE-005-002`; `AC-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-REVIEW-001-003`; SDD Section 31 |
| Evidence | `harness/src/config/config.ts:126-133`, `harness/src/config/config.ts:209-225`; independent sentinel probes accepted and retained `api_key=`, `apikey=`, `authorization=`, `cookie=`, and `private_key=` values. |
| Required Action | Extend fail-closed secret-value classification to cover normalized/obvious API-key, authorization, cookie, and private-key assignment markers in allowed string fields; ensure rejection diagnostics never retain or echo the value; add focused regression tests; issue a new immutable candidate/manifest and obtain new independent reviews. |

The implementation rejects several provider prefixes and four generic assignment words, but omits markers that its own key classifier already identifies as sensitive. A config value such as a repository URL containing `?api_key=<secret>` therefore survives validation and is retained in the immutable config, contradicting the explicit SDD prohibition on API keys and other secret values.

#### FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-001-002 - Agent-visible environment policy accepts JWT bearer credential names

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Finding ID | `FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-001-002` |
| Severity | `MAJOR` |
| Owner | `IMPLEMENTER` |
| Status | `OPEN` |
| Affected Requirements | `AC-HNS-CORE-005-002`; `AC-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-REVIEW-001-003`; SDD Sections 32 and 38 |
| Evidence | `harness/src/config/config.ts:120-125`, `harness/src/config/config.ts:376-387`; independent probes accepted `CI_JOB_JWT` and `CI_JOB_JWT_V2`, and `buildChildEnvironmentPolicy` returned them in its Agent-visible allowlist. |
| Required Action | Deny recognized bearer-credential environment markers, including JWT forms, from Agent-visible propagation; preserve the empty-baseline/explicit-allowlist model; add focused config and child-policy regression tests; issue a new immutable candidate/manifest and obtain new independent reviews. |

The environment classifier blocks token/key/password-style names but omits the equally credential-bearing JWT marker. This permits a CI bearer credential to be classified as Agent-visible even though Section 32 reserves secrets for tightly controlled Adapter-visible injection and Section 38 requires secret isolation.

### Scope and Limitations

- Reviewer write scope is limited to this append in `docs/08_agent_reviews/review_log.md`; no reviewed artifact, manifest, Work Item, governance file, prior evidence, status, package, source, or test was modified.
- This is `TECH_REVIEWER` evidence only. It does not act as QA, Security, Gate Checker, Implementer, merger, or lifecycle closer.
- Checked-in tests passed but were not trusted as sole evidence; provenance, content hashes, independent reference comparisons, runtime probes, and static capability/scope scans were performed.

### Decision

`REQUEST_CHANGES`

Candidate identity, scope, canonical serialization, SHA-256, narrowing, immutability, test discovery, and all official commands pass. However, two `OPEN MAJOR` findings remain in the config secret-isolation boundary, so `AC-HNS-CORE-005-002` and the assigned TECH review acceptance criteria are not satisfied for manifest SHA-256 `432afa16c262c514d36eb74e212d322f5579f641dc7e0883ac9266fee8a99b0d`.

### Remediation and Validation

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Exact remediation scope | `PASS` | Only `harness/src/config/config.ts` and `harness/tests/unit/config/config.test.mjs` changed. |
| Finding 001 correction | `READY_FOR_REVIEW` | Added normalized API-key, authorization, cookie, and private-key assignment rejection with raw-value non-disclosure tests. |
| Finding 002 correction | `READY_FOR_REVIEW` | Added JWT-bearing environment-name rejection and safe-name preservation tests. |
| `npm ci` / build / typecheck | `PASS` | Required runtime; strict build and no-emit typecheck passed. |
| Focused tests | `PASS` | 32 hash/config tests passed; 0 failed. |
| Default tests | `PASS` | 128 passed; 0 failed, cancelled, skipped, or todo; count is evidence only. |

| Forbidden boundary | `PASS` | No package, fixture, docs, Work Item, governance, runtime, adapter, I/O, hash module, or later-phase change. |

### Result

`READY_FOR_REVIEW`

The two Findings remain `OPEN` until an independent Reviewer validates the exact R2 candidate/hash. This Maker evidence is not TECH, QA, Security, or Gate approval.

| Timestamp | `2026-08-27T01:04:24Z` |

### Provenance and Identity Validation

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Fresh clone and exact origin | `PASS` | Fresh single-branch clone; origin is exactly `https://github.com/ivan-tsai1207/ai-system-delivery-framework.git`. |
| Branch and refreshed remote tip | `PASS` | Local HEAD and `git ls-remote` both resolved `feature/hns-core-005-config-hash` to `2a84841b8c0b64adeb911e823fcb3c633501ae92`; starting tree was clean. |
| Independent execution identity | `PASS` | Reviewer execution ID differs from all three Maker execution IDs and was absent from prior evidence. |
| Direct-parent lineage | `PASS` | `fb48e9c... -> efbe79d... -> 69cc152... -> 86aa33f... -> 7d0b7c3... -> 48a0e3e... -> 0e0166d... -> 2a84841...` was verified as a direct-parent chain. |
| Exact R2 manifest integrity | `PASS` | Exact worktree bytes hash to the assigned SHA-256; Git blob is `f01f210e4bb3b9ef920527fdafcb594ee8aa446c`. |
| All 15 artifact identities | `PASS` | Every manifest row independently matched both its recorded Git blob and content SHA-256 at review-start HEAD. |
| R2 replacement / inheritance | `PASS` | `config.ts` and `config.test.mjs` differ from R1 exactly as `REPLACEMENT`; the other 13 artifacts match R1 byte-for-byte exactly as `INHERITED`. |
| Remediation commit scope | `PASS` | `0e0166d...` modifies only `harness/src/config/config.ts` and `harness/tests/unit/config/config.test.mjs`. |
| Post-candidate immutability | `PASS` | No reviewed artifact changed from `0e0166d...` through review-start HEAD; intervening changes are control-plane manifest, evidence, and review Work Items only. |
| R1 supersession semantics | `PASS` | R1 manifest and review remain immutable historical evidence; R2 explicitly supersedes the R1 manifest and rebinds all current review checks to the R2 hash. |

### Commands and Scope Validation

| Command / Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime assertion | `PASS` | Required runtime resolved to Node `v24.19.0` and npm `11.17.0`. A preliminary host-default check was not used as evidence; `npm ci` and every recorded verification were rerun under the required runtime. |
| `npm ci` | `PASS` | 7 packages added; 8 packages audited; 0 vulnerabilities. |
| `npm run build` | `PASS` | Strict TypeScript build completed. |
| `npm run typecheck` | `PASS` | No-emit strict typecheck completed. |
| `npm test` | `PASS` | 128 passed; 0 failed, cancelled, skipped, or todo. Default discovery included root, core, schema, error, hash, and config suites. |
| Focused hash / config tests | `PASS` | 32 passed; 0 failed, cancelled, skipped, or todo. |
| `npm audit --audit-level=high` | `PASS` | 0 vulnerabilities. |
| Diff and dependency scope | `PASS` | `git diff --check` passed; package change is test discovery only; no lockfile or dependency drift. |
| Forbidden capability scan | `PASS` | No filesystem, network, process execution, Context/Policy compiler, audit store, persistence, runtime, adapter implementation, or later-phase capability was introduced. |
| Test integrity scan | `PASS` | No focused-only, skipped, or todo marker exists in the hash/config suites. |

### Independent R2 Technical Probes

| Probe | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| SHA-256 correctness | `PASS` | Independently matched Node `crypto` for 17 random byte lengths from 0 through 4097, including 55/56/63/64/65-byte padding boundaries. |
| UTF-8 correctness | `PASS` | Matched `TextEncoder` for ASCII, NFC/NFD Unicode, BMP, astral, control, and malformed-surrogate inputs. |
| Canonical serialization | `PASS` | Key ordering, Unicode normalization, null-prototype values, shared references, negative zero, cycles, non-canonical types, accessors without getter execution, symbols, and normalized-key collisions behaved fail closed as required. |
| Hash mismatch diagnostics | `PASS` | Invalid expected hashes fail closed; mismatch message and diagnostic never disclosed the independent sentinel and retained `[REDACTED]` artifact context. |
| Config narrowing and immutability | `PASS` | Visibility, adapters, environment, context budget, and timeout re-expansion were rejected; immutable snapshots did not retain later source mutations. |
| Unknown/accessor/key/environment boundary | `PASS` | Unknown keys, accessor-backed config, representative sensitive keys, and cloud/SSH/registry/production/token names were rejected without getter execution or sentinel disclosure. |
| R1 Finding 001 reproduction | `PASS` | `api_key`, `apikey`, `authorization`, `cookie`, `private_key`, and `privatekey` were tested with `=`, `:`, spacing, case, hyphen, and dot variants; every assignment was rejected and no error surface disclosed the raw value or sentinel. |
| Assignment false-positive regression | `PASS` | Ordinary API-key documentation, authorization/cookie policy, private-key documentation, and unrelated `monkey=value` repository text remained valid when no secret assignment marker was present. |
| R1 Finding 002 reproduction | `PASS` | `CI_JOB_JWT`, `CI_JOB_JWT_V2`, `JWT`, `BUILD_JWT`, `OIDC_JWT_ASSERTION`, `SERVICE_JWT_CREDENTIAL`, and `MYJWT` were rejected from Agent-visible allowlists. |
| Safe environment regression | `PASS` | `LANG`, `LC_ALL`, `TOOL_MODE`, `CI_JOB_ID`, and `HARNESS_COLOR` remained accepted, ordered, immutable, and narrowing-only in the empty-baseline child policy. |

### Finding Transitions

#### FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-001-001 - Obvious secret assignment markers bypass config value rejection

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Finding ID | `FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-001-001` |
| Severity | `MAJOR` |
| Prior Status | `OPEN` |
| New Status | `RESOLVED` |
| Closure Evidence | `REV-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-002`; R2 manifest SHA-256 `f9ad2bd656bed5a52d9c69c60cdbf2381282ee92aab34c8dab1b06bf44df25c0`; independent assignment-variant and non-disclosure probes. |

The R2 candidate rejects all required normalized API-key, authorization, cookie, and private-key assignment variants without retaining or echoing raw values. Representative non-assignment text remains valid, so the remediation closes the bypass without the tested false-positive regression.

#### FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-001-002 - Agent-visible environment policy accepts JWT bearer credential names

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Finding ID | `FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-001-002` |
| Severity | `MAJOR` |
| Prior Status | `OPEN` |
| New Status | `RESOLVED` |
| Closure Evidence | `REV-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-002`; R2 manifest SHA-256 `f9ad2bd656bed5a52d9c69c60cdbf2381282ee92aab34c8dab1b06bf44df25c0`; independent JWT rejection and safe-name preservation probes. |

The R2 candidate rejects the two reported CI JWT names and representative JWT bearer names while preserving explicitly allowed non-secret names and narrowing semantics.

### Findings and Limitations

- No new finding was identified.
- Both R1 `MAJOR` findings are `RESOLVED` only for the exact R2 manifest hash above; any reviewed-artifact change invalidates this closure evidence.
- Reviewer write scope is limited to this append in `docs/08_agent_reviews/review_log.md`; no implementation, manifest, test, package, Work Item, status, prior evidence, gate, merge, or lifecycle artifact was changed.
- This is `TECH_REVIEWER` evidence only. It does not act as QA, Security, Gate Checker, merger, or lifecycle closer.

### Decision

`PASS`

The complete R2 candidate satisfies the assigned technical review acceptance criteria. Provenance, scope, all 15 artifact identities, R2 replacement/inheritance, required commands, default discovery, and independent adversarial probes passed; both R1 findings are independently resolved with no new open technical finding.

### Context and Provenance Validation

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Fresh clone and exact origin | `PASS` | Fresh single-branch clone; origin is exactly `https://github.com/ivan-tsai1207/ai-system-delivery-framework.git`. |
| Branch and refreshed remote tip | `PASS` | Local HEAD, refreshed remote-tracking branch, and `git ls-remote` all resolved `feature/hns-core-005-config-hash` to `8bea2c334694f164569d993c3488bd19cf0a3a33`; starting tree was clean. |
| Independent execution identity | `PASS` | `REV-HNS-CORE-005-QA-002-EXEC` differs from all Maker and TECH execution IDs and was absent from prior evidence. |
| Candidate lineage | `PASS` | Base `fb48e9c...` and R2 candidate `0e0166d...` are ancestors of review-start HEAD; the candidate remained immutable after remediation. |
| Exact R2 manifest integrity | `PASS` | Exact worktree bytes independently hash to `f9ad2bd656bed5a52d9c69c60cdbf2381282ee92aab34c8dab1b06bf44df25c0`. |
| All 15 artifact identities | `PASS` | Every manifest row independently matched both its recorded Git blob and content SHA-256. |
| Post-candidate immutability | `PASS` | None of the 15 reviewed artifacts changed from `0e0166d...` through review-start HEAD. |
| TECH prerequisite binding | `PASS` | `REV-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-002` records `PASS` against this exact R2 manifest/hash and review commit `8bea2c...` is the review-start HEAD. |
| Context files | `PASS` | Loaded Tier 1 REVIEWER/QA governance, active Implementation Gate, assigned Work Item, primary/companion Work Items, direct SDD Sections 6, 31-32, 35, 38, 40.1, and 46 Phase 1, R2 manifest, Maker evidence, R1 findings, R2 TECH evidence, and reviewed artifacts only. |

### Commands and Reproducibility

| Command / Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime assertion | `PASS` | Every accepted command and probe used Node `v24.19.0` and npm `11.17.0`. |
| `npm ci` | `PASS` | 7 packages added; 8 packages audited; 0 vulnerabilities. |
| `npm run build` | `PASS` | Strict TypeScript build completed. |
| `npm run typecheck` | `PASS` | No-emit strict typecheck completed. |
| `npm test` | `PASS` | 128 passed; 0 failed, cancelled, skipped, or todo. Root, core, schema, error, hash, and config suites were all discovered by the default command. |
| Focused hash / config tests | `PASS` | 32 passed; 0 failed, cancelled, skipped, or todo. |
| `npm audit --audit-level=high` | `PASS` | 0 vulnerabilities. |
| Diff / dependency boundary | `PASS` | `git diff --check` passed; test-discovery commit changes only `harness/package.json`; no lockfile or dependency drift. |
| Test integrity | `PASS` | No skipped/todo markers were present in the repository test suites. |
| Forbidden capability / path scan | `PASS` | No filesystem, network, process, Context/Policy compiler, audit, adapter, execution, later-phase, forbidden-path, or lockfile change was introduced. |

### Independent QA Acceptance Probes

| Behavior | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| SHA-256 correctness and boundaries | `PASS` | Independently matched Node `crypto` for 14 deterministic byte lengths from 0 through 4097, including 55/56/63/64/65-byte padding boundaries. |
| UTF-8 and Unicode determinism | `PASS` | Matched `TextEncoder` for empty, ASCII, NFC/NFD, CJK, astral, newline, and malformed-surrogate inputs; canonical NFC-equivalent values and keys produced identical bytes/hashes. |
| Path-independent canonicalization | `PASS` | Independently loaded both differently located/ordered canonical fixtures; canonical bytes and SHA-256 matched exactly without source-path identity. |
| Canonical normal/boundary/negative behavior | `PASS` | Nested ordering, null-prototype objects, shared references, negative zero, cycles, normalized-key collisions, accessors without getter execution, unsupported primitives, non-finite numbers, and mutable non-plain objects behaved deterministically or failed closed as required. |
| Hash mismatch non-disclosure | `PASS` | Invalid expected hash failed closed; mismatch message, stack, serialized error, and diagnostic excluded the independent secret sentinel while exposing only expected/actual hashes and `[REDACTED]` artifact context. |
| Config version and unknown-key behavior | `PASS` | Exact v1 accepted; missing, older, newer, and non-string versions rejected; unknown top-level, nested, and layer keys failed closed. |
| Host/project/invocation precedence | `PASS` | Three-layer visibility, adapter, context, timeout, and environment narrowing produced the expected effective config; repository and audit identity remained host-owned. |
| Re-expansion negative behavior | `PASS` | More-public visibility, adapter reorder, context/timeout growth, unapproved environment, repository/audit replacement, and invocation environment re-expansion all failed with `CONFIG_NARROWING_VIOLATION`. |
| R1 secret-assignment regression | `PASS` | API-key, authorization, cookie, private-key, password, client-secret, and access-token markers across case, space, dot, hyphen, underscore, `=` and `:` variants were rejected without sentinel disclosure. Representative documentation and unrelated `monkey=value` text remained accepted. |
| R1 JWT/environment regression | `PASS` | Reported CI JWT names and broader JWT/cloud/SSH/registry/production credential names were rejected; `LANG`, `LC_ALL`, `TOOL_MODE`, `CI_JOB_ID`, and `HARNESS_COLOR` remained accepted. |
| Environment policy | `PASS` | Child policy used an immutable empty baseline, never inherited the parent environment, emitted names only, and preserved narrowing/order. |
| Immutability and repeatability | `PASS` | Effective config, nested sections, allowlists, and child policy were frozen; post-resolution source mutations did not alter snapshots; repeated pristine inputs produced deeply equal outputs. |
| Test discovery contract | `PASS` | Default script retains Node's built-in runner and all six required root/core/schema/error/hash/config globs; no framework or dependency was added. |
| Independent probe total | `PASS` | Corrected independent QA run completed 138 assertions with 0 failures. |

### Acceptance Criteria Mapping

| Acceptance Criteria | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-001` | `PASS` | Canonical ordering, NFC normalization, UTF-8 reference comparison, path-independent fixtures, SHA vectors, padding boundaries, and equivalent-input hash probes passed. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-002` | `PASS` | Version/unknown/secret fail-closed behavior, host-project-invocation narrowing, environment isolation, re-expansion negatives, and immutable snapshots passed. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-003` | `PASS` | Unicode/path-independent behavior and hash mismatch redaction were covered by checked-in tests and independent non-disclosure probes. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-004` | `PASS` | Static and diff scans found no Context/Policy compiler, audit store, runtime process, adapter behavior, I/O, dependency, or later-phase implementation. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-TEST-DISCOVERY-001` through `-006` | `PASS` | One default `npm test` invocation discovered root, core, schema, error, hash, and config suites. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-TEST-DISCOVERY-007` | `PASS` | All 128 discovered tests passed with no failed/skipped/todo tests; count was treated as execution evidence, not a permanent contract; companion commit changed package script only. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-QA-REVIEW-002-001` | `PASS` | Exact R2 manifest/hash and same-hash TECH prerequisite were independently verified. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-QA-REVIEW-002-002` | `PASS` | Every primary and companion AC passed independent acceptance and command verification. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-QA-REVIEW-002-003` | `PASS` | Both R1 regressions, diagnostic non-disclosure, safe-name preservation, and negative cases passed. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-QA-REVIEW-002-004` | `PASS` | Default/focused suites, prior CORE regression, discovery, and no-skip/todo checks passed. |

### Findings and Limitations

- No new QA finding was identified.
- This review does not modify the prior R1 finding records or their TECH-owned status transitions; it independently confirms their regression behavior only for the exact R2 manifest hash above.
- A preliminary QA probe incorrectly treated unchanged `public` visibility on a `public` host baseline as expansion. That probe result was discarded, its baseline corrected to `internal`, and the complete 138-assertion run was rerun successfully; no candidate artifact changed.
- Reviewer write scope is limited to this append in `docs/08_agent_reviews/review_log.md`; no implementation, manifest, package, tests, Work Item, status, prior evidence, finding state, gate, merge, or lifecycle artifact was modified.
- This is `QA_REVIEWER` evidence only. It does not act as TECH, Security, Gate Checker, Implementer, merger, or lifecycle closer.

### Decision

`PASS`

The exact HNS-CORE-005 R2 candidate satisfies every assigned primary, companion, and QA acceptance criterion. Required commands and independent normal, boundary, negative, regression, determinism, non-disclosure, narrowing, environment, immutability, and discovery checks passed with no new QA finding.

### Provenance and Independence Validation

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Fresh clone and exact origin | `PASS` | Fresh single-branch clone; origin is exactly `https://github.com/ivan-tsai1207/ai-system-delivery-framework.git`. |
| Branch and remote tip | `PASS` | Local HEAD and refreshed remote tip both resolved `feature/hns-core-005-config-hash` to `ea6014051fcbdc4b9307dd8acd29045d481c4e38`; starting tree was clean. |
| Independent execution identity | `PASS` | `REV-HNS-CORE-005-SECURITY-002-EXEC` was absent from prior evidence and differs from every Maker, TECH, and QA execution ID. |
| Candidate lineage | `PASS` | Base and R2 candidate are ancestors of review-start HEAD. |
| Exact manifest integrity | `PASS` | Exact worktree bytes independently hash to the assigned SHA-256; manifest blob is `f01f210e4bb3b9ef920527fdafcb594ee8aa446c`. |
| Artifact identity | `PASS` | All 15 manifest rows independently matched both the recorded Git blob and content SHA-256. |
| R2 replacement / inheritance | `PASS` | The two `REPLACEMENT` artifacts and thirteen `INHERITED` artifacts match the manifest classification and identities. |
| Post-candidate immutability | `PASS` | None of the 15 reviewed artifacts changed from `0e0166d...` through review-start HEAD. |
| Current TECH / QA evidence | `PASS` | Both evidence records exist, bind the same R2 manifest/hash, use distinct execution IDs, and preserve reviewed artifacts. Their conclusions were not trusted as substitutes for this review. |

### Commands and Scope Validation

| Command / Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime assertion | `PASS` | Every accepted command and probe used Node `v24.19.0` and npm `11.17.0`. |
| `npm ci` | `PASS` | 7 packages added; 8 packages audited; 0 vulnerabilities. |
| `npm run build` | `PASS` | Strict TypeScript build completed. |
| `npm run typecheck` | `PASS` | No-emit strict typecheck completed. |
| `npm test` | `PASS` | 128 passed; 0 failed, cancelled, skipped, or todo. |
| `npm audit --audit-level=high` | `PASS` | 0 vulnerabilities. |
| Diff / dependency boundary | `PASS` | `git diff --check` passed; no dependency or lockfile change exists in the candidate. |
| Capability boundary scan | `PASS` | Reviewed source contains no `process.env` read, child-process execution, filesystem/network access, external I/O, adapter, credential source, persistence, production, destructive, or later-phase implementation. |

### Threat and Control Results

| Threat / Control | Result | Independent Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| R1 assignment-marker closure | `PASS` | API-key, authorization, cookie, and private-key markers across case and separator variants were rejected without sentinel disclosure. |
| R1 JWT environment closure | `PASS` | `CI_JOB_JWT`, `CI_JOB_JWT_V2`, and representative token/cloud/SSH/registry/production credential names were rejected. |
| Known provider, bearer, private-key, and URL credentials | `PASS` | GitHub, Anthropic/OpenAI, Slack, Bearer, PEM private-key, and URL-userinfo forms were rejected without raw-value disclosure. |
| Additional provider and compact secret values | `FAIL` | GitLab PAT, Google API-key, Stripe secret-key, quoted API-key assignment, and compact token/password/credential assignment forms were accepted and retained. |
| Error-surface non-disclosure | `FAIL` | A synthetic provider-token-shaped unknown key was copied into `message`, `stack`, `configPath`, and serialized error output. |
| Agent-visible environment deny boundary | `FAIL` | Credential-source and process-injection names including Kubernetes/cloud config, Git SSH/helper, runtime option, loader preload, shell startup, Terraform, and OCI config forms were accepted. |
| Narrowing-only privilege behavior | `PASS` | Visibility, adapter, environment, context, and timeout re-expansion failed closed; safe ordered subsets remained valid. |
| Empty child baseline and safe names | `PASS` | Child policy remained `EMPTY`, disabled parent inheritance, emitted names only, and preserved `LANG`, `LC_ALL`, `TOOL_MODE`, `CI_JOB_ID`, and `HARNESS_COLOR`. |
| Immutable snapshots | `PASS` | Effective config, nested sections, allowlists, and child policy were frozen and isolated from source mutation. |
| Hostile object handling | `PASS` | Prototype-bearing objects, accessors without getter execution, symbols, custom classes, sparse arrays, and custom array properties failed closed; null-prototype plain data remained supported. |
| Independent probe total | `PASS_WITH_FINDINGS` | 197 assertions completed; all expected controls and all three finding reproductions were deterministic. |

### Findings

#### FND-HNS-CORE-005-SECURITY-002-001 - Provider and compact secret-value forms bypass rejection

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Finding ID | `FND-HNS-CORE-005-SECURITY-002-001` |
| Severity | `MAJOR` |
| Owner | `IMPLEMENTER` |
| Status | `OPEN` |
| Affected Requirements | `AC-HNS-CORE-005-002`; `AC-HNS-CORE-005-SECURITY-REVIEW-002-002`; SDD Sections 31 and 38 |
| Evidence | Independent probes accepted representative `glpat-`, `AIza`, and `sk_live_` provider credentials, quoted API-key assignment text, and compact token/password/credential assignment labels in allowed string fields. |
| Required Action | Extend fail-closed secret-value classification to the demonstrated high-confidence provider prefixes and normalized/quoted compact assignment forms; preserve ordinary non-secret text; add regression and raw-value non-disclosure tests; issue a new immutable candidate and manifest. |

The R2 remediation closes the exact R1 markers but the value classifier remains narrower than the canonical prohibition on API keys, credentials, and other secret values. Accepted values are retained inside immutable config snapshots, so this is a security-boundary defect rather than a test-only gap.

#### FND-HNS-CORE-005-SECURITY-002-002 - Secret-like unknown config key is disclosed by validation errors

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Finding ID | `FND-HNS-CORE-005-SECURITY-002-002` |
| Severity | `MAJOR` |
| Owner | `IMPLEMENTER` |
| Status | `OPEN` |
| Affected Requirements | `AC-HNS-CORE-005-002`; `AC-HNS-CORE-005-SECURITY-REVIEW-002-002`; SDD Sections 31 and 38 |
| Evidence | A synthetic GitHub-PAT-shaped unknown key was reproduced in `ConfigValidationError.message`, `stack`, `configPath`, and serialized error output because the key redaction classifier does not recognize provider credential prefixes. |
| Required Action | Make unknown-key path construction fail closed for high-confidence provider-token and secret-bearing key forms before any raw key enters an error object; verify all error surfaces and preserve useful non-sensitive unknown-key diagnostics. |

Value redaction alone is insufficient because an attacker-controlled or malformed config can place credential material in a property name. The current error object retains that key and can propagate it to logs or audit serialization.

#### FND-HNS-CORE-005-SECURITY-002-003 - Agent-visible allowlist accepts credential-source and process-injection names

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Finding ID | `FND-HNS-CORE-005-SECURITY-002-003` |
| Severity | `MAJOR` |
| Owner | `IMPLEMENTER` |
| Status | `OPEN` |
| Affected Requirements | `AC-HNS-CORE-005-002`; `AC-HNS-CORE-005-SECURITY-REVIEW-002-003`; SDD Sections 32 and 38 |
| Evidence | `KUBECONFIG`, `CLOUDSDK_CONFIG`, `GIT_SSH_COMMAND`, `GIT_ASKPASS`, `NODE_OPTIONS`, `LD_PRELOAD`, `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES`, `BASH_ENV`, `ENV`, `TF_CLI_CONFIG_FILE`, and `OCI_CLI_CONFIG_FILE` were accepted by config validation and emitted by child-policy construction. |
| Required Action | Deny credential-source, helper-command, runtime-option, loader-preload, shell-startup, and provider-config environment classes from Agent-visible propagation; keep the empty baseline and explicit safe-name behavior; add focused bypass and safe-name regressions. |

The current output contains names rather than values, but it authorizes later child-environment construction to copy host values under those names. These variables are not task-safe Agent-visible settings and can expose credential sources or alter child-process behavior.

### Acceptance Criteria Mapping

| Acceptance Criteria | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-SECURITY-REVIEW-002-001` | `PASS` | Exact R2 identity, immutable artifact binding, Maker separation, and independent Security execution were verified. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-SECURITY-REVIEW-002-002` | `FAIL` | R1 gaps are closed, but additional provider/compact secret values and a raw-key error disclosure remain. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-SECURITY-REVIEW-002-003` | `FAIL` | Narrowing, safe names, immutability, and hostile objects pass, but credential-source and process-injection environment names remain Agent-visible. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-SECURITY-REVIEW-002-004` | `PASS` | Static and dependency checks found no credential source, actual environment injection, external I/O, network, adapter, dependency, production, or destructive implementation expansion. |

### Scope and Limitations

- Reviewer write scope is limited to this append in `docs/08_agent_reviews/review_log.md`; no implementation, manifest, package, test, Work Item, status, prior evidence, prior finding state, gate, merge, accepted-risk, or lifecycle artifact was modified.
- Existing TECH and QA evidence remains immutable historical evidence on this hash, but it does not close these newly identified Security findings.
- This is `SECURITY_REVIEWER` evidence only. It does not act as Implementer, TECH, QA, Gate Checker, merger, accepted-risk authority, or lifecycle closer.

### Decision

`REQUEST_CHANGES`

The exact R2 candidate passes provenance, official commands, R1 regressions, narrowing, immutability, hostile-input checks, and the no-runtime-capability boundary. However, three `OPEN MAJOR` security findings remain in secret rejection, error non-disclosure, and Agent-visible environment filtering, so this candidate cannot proceed to `IMPLEMENTATION_GATE`.

### Result

`READY_FOR_REVIEW`

All three Security Findings remain `OPEN` until independent review of the exact R3 candidate/hash. This is Maker evidence only and is not TECH, QA, Security, or Gate approval.

| Exact R3 manifest integrity | `PASS` | Exact worktree bytes independently hash to `328a6a6bb984e37027275360c9b556e7eb3468fb874b078f73173f9292337410`. |
| All 15 artifact identities | `PASS` | Every manifest row independently matched both its recorded Git blob and content SHA-256. |
| R3 replacement / inheritance | `PASS` | The two `REPLACEMENT` artifacts differ from R2 as declared; all thirteen `INHERITED` artifacts match R2 byte-for-byte. |
| Post-candidate immutability | `PASS` | None of the 15 reviewed artifacts changed from `d230f65...` through review-start HEAD. |
| Maker / Reviewer separation | `PASS` | Maker and Reviewer execution IDs are distinct; this execution did not modify any reviewed artifact. Earlier evidence was used only for history and regression targeting, never as a substitute for independent verification. |

### Commands and Technical Validation

| Command / Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime assertion | `PASS` | Every accepted command and probe used Node `v24.19.0` and npm `11.17.0`. |
| `npm ci` | `PASS` | 7 packages added; 8 packages audited; 0 vulnerabilities. |
| `npm run build` | `PASS` | Strict TypeScript build completed. |
| `npm run typecheck` | `PASS` | No-emit strict typecheck completed. |
| `npm test` | `PASS` | 134 passed; 0 failed, cancelled, skipped, or todo. Root, core, schema, error, hash, and config suites were all discovered by the default command. |
| Focused hash / config tests | `PASS` | 38 passed; 0 failed, cancelled, skipped, or todo. |
| `npm audit --audit-level=high` | `PASS` | 0 vulnerabilities. |
| Diff / dependency boundary | `PASS` | `git diff --check` passed; the companion changes only `harness/package.json`; no lockfile or dependency change was introduced. |
| Capability boundary scan | `PASS` | No Context/Policy compiler, audit persistence, runtime process, environment injection, adapter, filesystem/network I/O, external integration, production operation, destructive behavior, or later-phase implementation was added. |

### Independent Technical and Adversarial Probes

| Behavior | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Canonical serialization and SHA-256 | `PASS` | Independently matched Node `crypto` for 18 byte lengths from 0 through 4097, including SHA-256 padding boundaries; key ordering, NFC normalization, UTF-8, shared references, negative zero, cycles, accessors without getter execution, non-plain objects, unsupported primitives, and mismatch redaction passed. |
| Config parsing and narrowing | `PASS` | Exact versioning, unknown-key rejection, three-layer narrowing, immutable snapshots, empty child baseline, source isolation, hostile-object rejection, and visibility/adapter/environment/timeout re-expansion negatives passed. |
| Historical TECH Finding regressions | `PASS` | API-key/authorization/cookie/private-key/password/client-secret/token assignment variants and both CI JWT names were independently rejected without raw-value disclosure. `FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-001-001` and `-002` remain `RESOLVED`. |
| Historical Security Finding exact regressions | `PASS` | The exact GitLab, Google, Stripe, quoted/compact assignment, provider-key redaction, credential-source, helper-command, runtime-option, loader-preload, shell-startup, Terraform, and OCI cases from `REV-HNS-CORE-005-SECURITY-002` now pass. This TECH execution does not transition Security-owned Finding status. |
| Generalized secret-value classification | `FAIL` | Additional high-confidence Stripe restricted, Google OAuth client-secret, npm access-token, SendGrid API-key, AWS temporary-access-key, CLI-style assignment, and escaped assignment classes were accepted and retained. |
| Generalized secret-key error surfaces | `FAIL` | Five additional high-confidence provider-token-shaped unknown-key classes were returned as `UNKNOWN_CONFIG_KEY` and appeared verbatim in `message`, `stack`, `configPath`, and serialized error output. |
| Generalized process-injection environment boundary | `FAIL` | Git config source/path, Git executable-path, compiler-wrapper, and command-prefix environment names were accepted into the Agent-visible allowlist. |
| False-positive controls | `FAIL` | Existing ordinary repository/path controls and seven established safe names pass, but benign assignment labels containing ordinary words and task-safe names containing marker substrings such as keyboard, tokenizer, or authors are rejected solely by substring matching. |
| Independent probe total | `FAIL_WITH_FINDINGS` | Corrected complete run executed 113 assertions: 90 passed and 23 failed, grouped into the three findings below. A preliminary UTF-8 oracle incorrectly normalized raw `encodeUtf8` input; that result was discarded, the oracle was corrected to raw `TextEncoder` semantics, and the full 113-assertion run was rerun. |

### Findings

#### FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-003-001 - Generalized secret classifier still permits high-confidence credentials and discloses secret-shaped keys

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Finding ID | `FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-003-001` |
| Severity | `MAJOR` |
| Owner | `IMPLEMENTER` |
| Status | `OPEN` |
| Affected Requirements | `AC-HNS-CORE-005-002`; `AC-HNS-CORE-005-003`; SDD Sections 31 and 38 |
| Evidence | Eight independently generated high-confidence provider/assignment value classes were accepted and retained. Five provider-token-shaped unknown-key classes were classified as ordinary unknown keys and leaked through every tested error surface. No raw synthetic credential is recorded in this evidence. |
| Required Action | Replace the narrow provider/assignment allow-by-miss behavior with a maintainable high-confidence classifier that covers the reproduced provider and assignment classes for both values and keys; redact before error construction; preserve ordinary text; add non-disclosure and false-positive regressions; issue a new immutable candidate and manifest. |

R3 closes the exact three provider prefixes and assignment forms named by the R2 Security review, but the same architectural boundary remains incomplete for other well-formed, high-confidence credential classes. Because accepted values are retained in immutable config and raw secret-shaped keys enter diagnostic surfaces, this is an implementation security-boundary defect.

#### FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-003-002 - Additional process-injection environment names remain Agent-visible

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Finding ID | `FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-003-002` |
| Severity | `MAJOR` |
| Owner | `IMPLEMENTER` |
| Status | `OPEN` |
| Affected Requirements | `AC-HNS-CORE-005-002`; SDD Sections 32 and 38 |
| Evidence | Independent probes accepted Git global/system config source, Git executable path, compiler-wrapper, and command-prefix environment classes and emitted them through `buildChildEnvironmentPolicy`. |
| Required Action | Extend the denied environment policy to the reproduced high-confidence Git configuration/executable and toolchain command-wrapper classes; retain the empty baseline and explicit safe-name narrowing; add focused regressions without broad substring matching. |

These names can alter child-process configuration or command resolution when a later runtime copies their host values. Explicit presence in an allowlist is not sufficient to make process-injection classes task-safe under the canonical environment isolation contract.

#### FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-003-003 - Substring markers overblock non-secret values and safe environment names

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Finding ID | `FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-003-003` |
| Severity | `MAJOR` |
| Owner | `IMPLEMENTER` |
| Status | `OPEN` |
| Affected Requirements | `AC-HNS-CORE-005-002`; `AC-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-REVIEW-003-002`; SDD Sections 31-32 |
| Evidence | Two benign assignment labels and three task-safe environment names were rejected only because ordinary words contained sensitive substrings. Existing ordinary repository/path controls do not exercise these token-boundary cases. |
| Required Action | Use token/boundary-aware classification for assignment labels and environment names. Continue rejecting canonical secret markers and dangerous environment classes while accepting reproduced benign words and existing safe controls; add both positive and negative regression matrices. |

The current substring policy creates a functional false-positive regression and conflicts with the assigned requirement to validate generalized classifiers without overblocking. A remediation should refine classification semantics instead of weakening secret or environment isolation.

### Acceptance Criteria Mapping

| Acceptance Criteria | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-REVIEW-003-001` | `PASS` | Exact R3 identity, lineage, 15 artifact identities, two replacements, thirteen inherited artifacts, post-candidate immutability, and Maker/Reviewer separation were independently verified. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-REVIEW-003-002` | `FAIL` | Exact historical regressions pass, but generalized secret/key/env probes expose additional bypasses and false-positive overblocking. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-REVIEW-003-003` | `FAIL` | Primary canonical hash behavior, commands, discovery, dependency, and capability boundaries pass, but `AC-HNS-CORE-005-002` fails for the classifier defects above. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-REVIEW-003-004` | `PASS` | This evidence and its new Findings are appended only to `docs/08_agent_reviews/review_log.md`. |

### Scope and Limitations

- Reviewer write scope is limited to this append in `docs/08_agent_reviews/review_log.md`; no implementation, manifest, package, test, Work Item, status, prior evidence, prior Finding state, Gate, merge, or lifecycle artifact was modified.
- The three R2 Security Finding exact reproductions now pass, but their formal lifecycle remains with the assigned independent `SECURITY_REVIEWER`; this TECH execution does not mark them `RESOLVED`.
- This is `TECH_REVIEWER` evidence only. It does not act as Implementer, QA, Security, Gate Checker, merger, accepted-risk authority, or lifecycle closer.

### Decision

`REQUEST_CHANGES`

The exact R3 candidate passes provenance, immutable identity, official commands, all five historical Finding regressions, canonical hash behavior, narrowing, hostile-input handling, dependency checks, and forbidden-capability boundaries. It cannot proceed as a TECH PASS because three `OPEN MAJOR` classifier findings remain; remediation requires a new candidate manifest and fresh independent TECH, QA, and Security reviews.

### Result

`READY_FOR_REVIEW`

### Provenance, Identity, and Separation

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Fresh checkout and origin | `PASS` | Fresh single-branch clone under `/private/tmp`; origin exactly `https://github.com/ivan-tsai1207/ai-system-delivery-framework.git`; neither prohibited existing checkout was used. |
| Branch start and remote | `PASS` | Local branch, remote-tracking ref, and `git ls-remote` resolved `feature/hns-core-005-config-hash` to `6934759becc481fa948cc09fa70082ffb356fd56` before review. |
| Independent execution | `PASS` | `REV-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-004-EXEC-20260925T205155Z` was absent from prior evidence and differs from every Maker and prior Reviewer execution ID. |
| Direct-parent lineage | `PASS` | Independently enumerated the single-parent chain from `fb48e9c...` through R1, R2, R3, and R4 candidate `2d79a2c...`; review-start `6934759...` is the direct child of the R4 candidate. |
| Manifest identity | `PASS` | Exact worktree bytes hash to assigned SHA-256 `b9767c...`; Git blob is `a540bab...`; superseded R3 manifest independently hashes to declared `328a6a6...`. |
| Artifact identity | `PASS` | All 15 R4 manifest rows independently matched both declared Git blob and content SHA-256 at candidate commit. |
| Replacement / inheritance | `PASS` | Exactly two `REPLACEMENT` rows differ from R3 (`config.ts`, `config.test.mjs`); all 13 `INHERITED` rows are byte-identical to R3. |
| Post-candidate immutability | `PASS` | All 15 reviewed artifacts are byte-identical between `2d79a2c...` and review-start `6934759...`; the intervening commit contains review preparation/evidence only. |
| Maker / Reviewer separation | `PASS` | This execution did not modify the manifest or any reviewed artifact and used prior conclusions only to target independent regression checks. |

### Commands and Technical Validation

| Command / Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime acquisition | `PASS` | Host Node was `v24.16.0`; official `node-v24.19.0-darwin-arm64.tar.gz` was downloaded to temporary storage and matched published SHA-256 `8294b7aa9b03997481c06babf1e8b270c859358f27da57a11509afe537ac381d`. Every accepted build, test, audit, and probe used Node `v24.19.0` / npm `11.17.0`. |
| `npm ci` | `PASS` | 7 packages added; 8 packages audited; 0 vulnerabilities. |
| `npm run build` | `PASS` | Strict TypeScript build completed. |
| `npm run typecheck` | `PASS` | No-emit strict typecheck completed. |
| `npm test` | `PASS` | 135 passed; 0 failed, cancelled, skipped, or todo; root, core, schema, error, hash, and config suites were discovered. |
| Focused hash / config tests | `PASS` | 39 passed; 0 failed, cancelled, skipped, or todo. |
| `npm audit --audit-level=high` | `PASS` | 0 vulnerabilities. |
| Lint / formatter | `NOT_APPLICABLE` | No lint or formatter script is defined in `harness/package.json`; build and typecheck are the available static commands. |
| Diff / test integrity | `PASS` | `git diff --check` passed; no `.skip`, `.todo`, `.only`, or equivalent disabling marker was found under `harness/tests`. |
| Candidate scope | `PASS` | R4 commit changes only `harness/src/config/config.ts` and `harness/tests/unit/config/config.test.mjs`; prior primary and companion commits remain within their exact authorized source/test/fixture and package-discovery scopes. |
| Dependency boundary | `PASS` | Only the default test script changed in `harness/package.json`; no dependency or lockfile change exists. |
| Capability boundary | `PASS` | Static source and diff scans found no Context/Policy compiler, audit persistence, runtime process, `process.env` read, environment injection, filesystem/network I/O, adapter, external integration, production operation, destructive behavior, or later-phase implementation. |

### Independent Technical and Adversarial Probes

The corrected full independent matrix executed 105 assertions: 93 passed and 12 failed. A preliminary 108-assertion run included three over-broad benign-label expectations (`authorization-guide`, `cookie-policy`, and `private-key-docs` assignments); that oracle was discarded, those expectations were removed, and the complete corrected matrix was rerun without changing the candidate.

| Behavior | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Canonical serialization and SHA-256 | `PASS` | SHA-256 independently matched Node `crypto` at 11 deterministic lengths from 0 through 4097, including 55/56/63/64/65-byte boundaries; canonical key ordering and NFC-equivalent values matched. |
| Historical secret/provider regressions | `PASS` | API-key, authorization, private-key, compact/camel labels, CLI flags, npm `_authToken`, Stripe restricted/webhook, Google OAuth, npm, SendGrid, AWS temporary key, bearer, URL-userinfo, and private-key forms were rejected without raw-value disclosure. |
| Secret-shaped key redaction | `PASS` | Six independently generated provider or semantic secret-key classes returned `SECRET_CONFIG_REJECTED`; key material was absent from message, stack, `configPath`, and JSON surfaces. |
| Escaped / encoded assignment classification | `FAIL` | `client\\-secret=<synthetic>`, quoted `api\\_key=<synthetic>`, and a URL query using `api%5Fkey=<synthetic>` were accepted and retained. The assignment regexes at `config.ts:303-323` do not admit escaped label separators or decode a high-confidence encoded query label before classification. |
| Established false-positive controls | `PASS` | Benign repository text and `keyboard`, `tokenizer`, `authors-style`, and `monkey` assignments remained accepted; `KEYBOARD_LAYOUT`, `TOKENIZER_MODE`, `AUTHORS_STYLE`, and six additional task-safe environment names remained accepted and narrowable. |
| Historical environment regressions | `PASS` | 31 denied credential, Git config/executable, compiler/toolchain, loader, shell, cloud, registry, and production names were rejected. |
| Additional process-injection environment boundary | `FAIL` | `GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE`, `GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY`, `GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES`, `GIT_INDEX_FILE`, `CCACHE_PREFIX`, `CCACHE_PREFIX_CPP`, `CMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER`, and `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER` were accepted and emitted by `buildChildEnvironmentPolicy`. The finite deny tables at `config.ts:166-244` and matcher at `config.ts:556-565` do not cover these repository redirection and compiler command-launch classes. |
| Narrowing and immutable child policy | `PASS` | Visibility, adapter, context, timeout, and environment narrowing succeeded for valid subsets; five re-expansion attempts failed with `CONFIG_NARROWING_VIOLATION`; child policy remained empty-baseline and names-only. |

The environment failures are process-control behavior, not merely naming concerns: Git documents the accepted `GIT_*` variables as redirecting repository, worktree, index, and object storage paths; CMake documents `CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_LAUNCHER` as a command line run before the compiler; and ccache documents `CCACHE_PREFIX` / `CCACHE_PREFIX_CPP` as command prefixes for compiler/preprocessor execution. These classes conflict with SDD Sections 32 and 38 and the existing R3 requirement to deny Git path, compiler-wrapper, and command-prefix environment controls.

### Finding Status

#### FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-003-001 - Generalized secret classifier still permits high-confidence credentials and discloses secret-shaped keys

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Finding ID | `FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-003-001` |
| Severity / Owner | `MAJOR` / `IMPLEMENTER` |
| Prior Status / Current Status | `OPEN` / `OPEN` |
| Affected Requirements | `AC-HNS-CORE-005-002`; `AC-HNS-CORE-005-003`; `AC-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-REVIEW-004-002`; SDD Sections 31 and 38 |
| Evidence | Corrected independent matrix accepted and retained two shell-escaped sensitive labels and one URL-encoded API-key query label; 19 unescaped/known secret classes and six secret-key redaction classes passed. |
| Required Action | Normalize supported shell-escaped label separators and high-confidence encoded assignment labels before boundary-aware classification, preserve the passing benign controls, add positive/negative regressions, issue a new immutable candidate/manifest, and obtain fresh independent review. |

R4 materially improves provider, compact, quoted, CLI, npm, and redaction behavior, but the existing finding is not fully remediated because semantically equivalent escaped/encoded labels bypass the classifier and remain in immutable config.

#### FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-003-002 - Additional process-injection environment names remain Agent-visible

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Finding ID | `FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-003-002` |
| Severity / Owner | `MAJOR` / `IMPLEMENTER` |
| Prior Status / Current Status | `OPEN` / `OPEN` |
| Affected Requirements | `AC-HNS-CORE-005-002`; `AC-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-REVIEW-004-002`; SDD Sections 32 and 38 |
| Evidence | Nine independently probed Git repository-path, ccache command-prefix, and CMake compiler-launcher variables were accepted and emitted as Agent-visible; 31 historical denied-name controls passed. |
| Required Action | Extend the deny policy to high-confidence Git repository redirection and compiler command-launch/prefix classes, retain passing safe-name and narrowing controls, add focused regressions, issue a new immutable candidate/manifest, and obtain fresh independent review. |

The R4 deny list closes the exact Git config/executable and several toolchain cases from R3, but it still permits variables that redirect Git filesystem state or place arbitrary launch commands in front of compiler/preprocessor execution.

#### FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-003-003 - Substring markers overblock non-secret values and safe environment names

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Finding ID | `FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-003-003` |
| Severity / Owner | `MAJOR` / `IMPLEMENTER` |
| Prior Status / New Status | `OPEN` / `RESOLVED` |
| Closure Evidence | `REV-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-004`; exact R4 manifest SHA-256 `b9767c48f911032bee57416e024f1363fb20c15a7d9862731fbae50151052314`; checked-in and independent positive/negative boundary matrices. |

Token- and sequence-aware classification preserves all reproduced benign assignment labels and task-safe environment names while canonical sensitive labels remain denied. No tested substring-only false-positive regression remains for this exact R4 artifact.

### Acceptance Criteria Mapping

| Acceptance Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-REVIEW-004-001` | `PASS` | Exact R4 manifest/hash, full direct-parent lineage, R1-R4 supersession, 15 artifact identities, two replacements, thirteen inherited artifacts, post-candidate immutability, and Maker/Reviewer separation were independently verified. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-REVIEW-004-002` | `FAIL` | Historical and most R4 regressions pass and Finding 003 is resolved, but Findings 001 and 002 remain `OPEN` on escaped/encoded assignments and process-injection environment classes. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-REVIEW-004-003` | `FAIL` | Commands, discovery, canonical hash, scope, dependency, and forbidden-capability boundaries pass; the primary config contract still fails for the two open classifier defects. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-REVIEW-004-004` | `PASS` | This execution appends evidence only to `docs/08_agent_reviews/review_log.md`; no reviewed artifact, manifest, Work Item, governance file, or prior evidence was modified. |

### Scope and Limitations

- Reviewer write scope is limited to this append in `docs/08_agent_reviews/review_log.md`; no implementation, manifest, package, test, Work Item, governance, prior evidence, Gate, merge, or lifecycle artifact was modified.
- R1 TECH finding regressions remain passing. Exact R2 Security finding reproductions pass, but formal Security-owned lifecycle remains with `SECURITY_REVIEWER` and is not transitioned here.
- This is `TECH_REVIEWER` evidence only. It does not act as QA, Security, Gate Checker, Implementer, merger, accepted-risk authority, or lifecycle closer.
- No GateResult is issued. The active `IMPLEMENTATION_GATE` cannot treat this TECH execution as passing evidence while two `OPEN MAJOR` findings remain.

### Decision

`REQUEST_CHANGES`

R4 has valid provenance, immutable identity, exact scope, green official commands, correct canonical hash behavior, and a successful false-positive remediation. It does not satisfy the assigned technical review because two existing `MAJOR` findings remain open: escaped/encoded sensitive assignment labels bypass secret rejection, and Git repository redirection plus compiler launcher/prefix environment variables remain Agent-visible.

### Result

`READY_FOR_REVIEW`

The two open TECH Findings remain `OPEN` until independent review of the exact R5 candidate/hash. This is Maker evidence only and is not TECH, QA, Security, or Gate approval.

### Provenance, Identity, and Separation

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Fresh clone and origin | `PASS` | Fresh single-branch clone at `/private/tmp/hns-core-005-review-r5.3ktizQ/repo`; origin exactly `https://github.com/ivan-tsai1207/ai-system-delivery-framework.git`; neither existing user checkout was used or modified. |
| Branch and remote start | `PASS` | Local HEAD, remote-tracking ref, and `git ls-remote` resolved `feature/hns-core-005-config-hash` to `6ce7f314f1f1fb01b7da9103ec5a546d16da4ea7` before review; starting tree was clean. |
| Independent execution | `PASS` | `REV-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-005-EXEC-20260925T210409Z` was absent from prior evidence and differs from every Maker and prior Reviewer execution ID. |
| Direct-parent lineage | `PASS` | The base-to-candidate ancestry contains 17 single-parent commits and no merge commit; R5 candidate parent is R4 TECH review commit `ea6034f3bf26ec5651a19381f72bb1dffb6c17c9`; review-start HEAD is the direct child of the R5 candidate. |
| Manifest and supersession | `PASS` | Exact R5 manifest bytes match the assigned SHA-256 and Git blob; the superseded R4 manifest independently matches declared SHA-256 `b9767c48f911032bee57416e024f1363fb20c15a7d9862731fbae50151052314`. |
| All 15 artifact identities | `PASS` | Every row independently matched both its declared Git blob and content SHA-256 at candidate commit `b0dd20c...`. |
| Replacement / inheritance | `PASS` | Exactly `config.ts` and `config.test.mjs` differ from R4 as `REPLACEMENT`; all 13 `INHERITED` artifacts are byte-identical to R4. |
| Candidate scope and immutability | `PASS` | R5 commit changes only the two authorized config implementation/test artifacts; all 15 reviewed artifacts are byte-identical between candidate and review-start HEAD. |
| Maker / Reviewer separation | `PASS` | This execution modified no reviewed artifact or manifest and used prior evidence only to identify historical cases for independent reproduction. |

### Commands and Technical Validation

| Command / Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime assertion | `PASS` | Every accepted build, test, audit, and independent probe used Node `v24.19.0` and npm `11.17.0`. |
| `npm ci` | `PASS` | 7 packages added; 8 packages audited; 0 vulnerabilities. |
| `npm run build` | `PASS` | Strict TypeScript build completed. |
| `npm run typecheck` | `PASS` | No-emit strict typecheck completed. |
| `npm test` | `PASS` | 136 passed; 0 failed, cancelled, skipped, or todo; root, core, schema, error, hash, and config suites were discovered. |
| Focused hash / config tests | `PASS` | 40 passed; 0 failed, cancelled, skipped, or todo. |
| `npm audit --audit-level=high` | `PASS` | 0 vulnerabilities. |
| Lint / formatter | `NOT_APPLICABLE` | No lint or formatter script is defined in `harness/package.json`; build and typecheck are the available static commands. |
| Diff / test integrity | `PASS` | `git diff --check` passed; no `.only`, `.skip`, `.todo`, or equivalent disabling marker was found under `harness/tests`. |
| Dependency and package boundary | `PASS` | R5 changes no package or lockfile; the inherited package change remains limited to default test discovery and introduces no dependency. |
| Capability boundary | `PASS` | Static import/source and candidate-diff scans found no Context/Policy compiler, audit persistence, runtime process, `process.env` read, environment injection, filesystem/network I/O, adapter, external integration, production operation, destructive behavior, or later-phase implementation. |

### Independent Technical and Adversarial Probes

The full independent matrix executed 135 assertions: 133 passed and 2 failed. A separate 10-case characterization matrix then confirmed five escaped-separator forms rejected with non-disclosure and five accepted and retained; it did not alter candidate artifacts.

| Behavior | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Historical R1 TECH findings | `PASS` | 13 API-key, authorization, cookie, private-key, password, client-secret, token, CLI, and npm assignment cases rejected without disclosure; both CI JWT names and broader historical environment controls rejected. |
| Historical R2 Security findings | `PASS` | 12 provider/bearer/URL/private-key value classes and 11 secret-shaped key classes failed closed without disclosure; all exact credential-source, helper, runtime, loader, shell, Terraform, OCI, Git, and toolchain environment reproductions rejected. This TECH review does not transition Security-owned findings. |
| Exact R4 escaped / encoded reproductions | `PASS` | Escaped hyphen, underscore, and dot labels, escaped assignment delimiter, CLI escaped label, and `%5F` / `%2D` / `%2E` query-label cases rejected without sentinel disclosure. |
| Narrow URL decoding | `PASS` | Upper/lower-case supported encodings rejected only in query-label position; double encoding, unrelated `%2F` / `%3A` / `%5A`, non-sensitive encoded labels, encoded value text, and the same encoded label outside query position remained accepted. |
| Generalized escaped separators | `FAIL` | Quoted and unquoted escaped-colon API-key labels, quoted escaped-colon client-secret labels, and quoted/unquoted escaped-equals client-secret labels were accepted and retained. Escaped space, hyphen, underscore, and dot controls rejected correctly. |
| All nine R4 process-control names | `PASS` | `GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE`, `GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY`, `GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES`, `GIT_INDEX_FILE`, `CCACHE_PREFIX`, `CCACHE_PREFIX_CPP`, `CMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER`, and `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER` all rejected. |
| False-positive controls | `PASS` | Eight benign repository/assignment controls, including keyboard, tokenizer, authors-style, monkey, escaped benign separators, and encoded benign query labels, remained accepted. All eight task-safe environment names, including `KEYBOARD_LAYOUT`, `TOKENIZER_MODE`, and `AUTHORS_STYLE`, remained accepted, ordered, immutable, and narrowable. |
| Narrowing and immutability | `PASS` | Valid three-layer narrowing passed; five visibility/adapter/context/timeout/environment re-expansions failed with `CONFIG_NARROWING_VIOLATION`; effective config and child policy were deeply frozen and isolated from source mutation. |
| Canonical serialization and hash | `PASS` | 14 SHA-256 lengths from 0 through 4097 independently matched Node `crypto`, including 55/56/63/64/65-byte boundaries; eight UTF-8 cases matched `TextEncoder`; ordering, NFC equivalence, path-independent shape, verification, negative zero, cycle, unsupported, and non-finite handling passed. |

The failure is visible in `harness/src/config/config.ts:270-280` and `:328-350`: normalization explicitly recognizes escaped `:` and `=` separators, but the quoted, unquoted, and CLI label extractors admit only escaped whitespace, dot, underscore, or hyphen. Therefore the sensitive label never reaches normalization for several semantically equivalent escaped forms. The checked-in R5 regression matrix at `harness/tests/unit/config/config.test.mjs:179-198` covers escaped hyphen, underscore, and dot but not escaped colon or equals labels.

### Finding Lifecycle

| Finding | Prior Status | Current Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-001-001` | `RESOLVED` | `RESOLVED` | Historical assignment forms and non-disclosure independently pass on R5. |
| `FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-001-002` | `RESOLVED` | `RESOLVED` | CI JWT regressions and safe-name controls independently pass on R5. |
| `FND-HNS-CORE-005-SECURITY-002-001` | `OPEN` | `OPEN` | Exact value regressions pass, but lifecycle ownership remains with `SECURITY_REVIEWER`. |
| `FND-HNS-CORE-005-SECURITY-002-002` | `OPEN` | `OPEN` | Exact key non-disclosure regressions pass, but lifecycle ownership remains with `SECURITY_REVIEWER`. |
| `FND-HNS-CORE-005-SECURITY-002-003` | `OPEN` | `OPEN` | Exact environment regressions pass, but lifecycle ownership remains with `SECURITY_REVIEWER`. |
| `FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-003-001` | `OPEN` | `OPEN` | R4 exact escaped/encoded cases pass, but escaped colon/equal sensitive assignment labels remain accepted and retained. |
| `FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-003-002` | `OPEN` | `RESOLVED` | All nine reproduced Git repository-redirection, ccache prefix, and CMake compiler-launcher names reject on exact R5 identity. |
| `FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-003-003` | `RESOLVED` | `RESOLVED` | Benign label and task-safe environment controls remain passing without substring overblocking. |

#### FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-003-001 - Generalized secret classifier still permits escaped sensitive assignment labels

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Finding ID | `FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-003-001` |
| Severity / Owner | `MAJOR` / `IMPLEMENTER` |
| Prior Status / Current Status | `OPEN` / `OPEN` |
| Affected Requirements | `AC-HNS-CORE-005-002`; `AC-HNS-CORE-005-003`; `AC-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-REVIEW-005-002`; SDD Sections 31 and 38 |
| Evidence | The independent 135-assertion matrix failed both escaped-colon API-key cases. A follow-up 10-case matrix accepted and retained five quoted/unquoted escaped-colon or escaped-equals API-key/client-secret forms while the adjacent escaped space/hyphen/underscore/dot controls rejected without disclosure. No synthetic secret is recorded here. |
| Required Action | Align assignment-label extraction with the declared escaped-separator normalization for supported colon/equal forms, preserve narrow URL decoding and all passing benign controls, add positive/negative and non-disclosure regressions, issue a new immutable candidate/manifest, and obtain fresh independent review. |

R5 closes the exact three R4 escaped/encoded examples and retains narrow decoding, but the same classifier boundary remains incomplete. Sensitive values accepted through these forms are retained in immutable config, so the primary fail-closed requirement is not satisfied.

#### FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-003-002 - Additional process-injection environment names remain Agent-visible

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Finding ID | `FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-003-002` |
| Severity / Owner | `MAJOR` / `IMPLEMENTER` |
| Prior Status / New Status | `OPEN` / `RESOLVED` |
| Closure Evidence | `REV-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-005`; exact R5 manifest SHA-256 `499514daba7b8d7da9cd8cdb83ccfe5499b5a48b614459479741b6b55ee16a71`; all nine exact environment names rejected in independent probes. |

### Acceptance Criteria Mapping

| Acceptance Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-REVIEW-005-001` | `PASS` | Exact R5 manifest/hash, direct-parent lineage, R4 supersession, all 15 identities, two replacements, thirteen inherited artifacts, post-candidate immutability, and Maker/Reviewer separation independently verified. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-REVIEW-005-002` | `FAIL` | All nine environment names and the exact R4 escaped/encoded cases pass, and the resolved false-positive boundary remains green; generalized escaped colon/equal sensitive assignments still bypass rejection. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-REVIEW-005-003` | `FAIL` | Commands, discovery, canonical hash, narrowing, immutability, scope, dependency, and capability checks pass, but primary `AC-HNS-CORE-005-002` and diagnostic coverage in `AC-HNS-CORE-005-003` remain unsatisfied by the open classifier defect. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-REVIEW-005-004` | `PASS` | This execution appends only to `docs/08_agent_reviews/review_log.md`; no reviewed artifact, manifest, Work Item, governance file, or prior evidence was modified. |

### Scope and Limitations

- Reviewer write scope is limited to this append in `docs/08_agent_reviews/review_log.md`; no reviewed artifact, manifest, package, Work Item, governance file, prior evidence, Gate, merge, or lifecycle artifact was modified.
- This is `TECH_REVIEWER` evidence only. It does not act as QA, Security, Gate Checker, Implementer, merger, accepted-risk authority, or lifecycle closer.
- No GateResult is issued. The active `IMPLEMENTATION_GATE` cannot treat this TECH execution as passing evidence while `FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-003-001` remains `OPEN MAJOR`.

### Decision

`REQUEST_CHANGES`

R5 has valid provenance, immutable identity, exact scope, green official commands, correct canonical hash behavior, complete closure of the nine process-control environment cases, narrow encoded-label decoding, and preserved false-positive boundaries. It does not satisfy the assigned technical review because escaped colon/equal sensitive assignment labels still bypass fail-closed secret rejection and are retained in immutable config.

### Result

`READY_FOR_REVIEW`

The remaining TECH Finding stays `OPEN` until independent review of the exact R6 candidate/hash. This is Maker evidence only and is not TECH, QA, Security, or Gate approval.

### Provenance, Identity, and Separation

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Fresh clone and origin | `PASS` | Fresh single-branch clone at `/tmp/hns-core-005-tech-review-006.XldYuR/repo`; origin exactly `https://github.com/ivan-tsai1207/ai-system-delivery-framework`; neither user checkout was used or modified. |
| Branch and remote start | `PASS` | Local HEAD, remote-tracking ref, and `git ls-remote` resolved `feature/hns-core-005-config-hash` to `6df4ede5ef76e4342699b62cf844846b0103d39a` before review; starting tree was clean. |
| Independent execution | `PASS` | `REV-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-006-EXEC-20260925T211616Z` was absent from prior evidence and differs from every Maker and prior Reviewer execution ID. |
| Direct-parent lineage | `PASS` | The base-to-candidate ancestry contains 20 commits and no merge commit; R6 candidate parent is R5 TECH review commit `7a2b9ab399fde3447a4cdb2ea34974bbf3268d55`; review-start HEAD is the direct child of the R6 candidate. |
| Manifest and supersession | `PASS` | Exact R6 manifest bytes match the assigned SHA-256 and Git blob; the superseded R5 manifest independently matches declared SHA-256 `499514daba7b8d7da9cd8cdb83ccfe5499b5a48b614459479741b6b55ee16a71`. |

| Maker / Reviewer separation | `PASS` | This execution modified no reviewed artifact or manifest and used prior evidence only to identify historical cases for independent reproduction. |

### Commands and Technical Validation

| Command / Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime assertion | `PASS` | Every accepted install, build, test, audit, and independent probe used Node `v24.19.0` and npm `11.17.0`; host-default versions were not used as evidence. |
| `npm ci` | `PASS` | 7 packages added; 8 packages audited; 0 vulnerabilities. |
| `npm run build` | `PASS` | Strict TypeScript build completed. |
| `npm run typecheck` | `PASS` | No-emit strict typecheck completed. |
| `npm test` | `PASS` | 137 passed; 0 failed, cancelled, skipped, or todo; root, core, schema, error, hash, and config suites were discovered. |
| Focused hash / config tests | `PASS` | 41 passed; 0 failed, cancelled, skipped, or todo. |
| `npm audit --audit-level=high` | `PASS` | 0 vulnerabilities. |
| Lint / formatter | `NOT_APPLICABLE` | No lint or formatter script is defined in `harness/package.json`; build and typecheck are the available static commands. |
| Diff / test integrity | `PASS` | `git diff --check` passed for full lineage and R6; no `.only`, `.skip`, `.todo`, or equivalent disabling marker was found under `harness/tests`. |
| Dependency and package boundary | `PASS` | R6 changes no package or lockfile; no dependency drift exists from R5. |
| Capability boundary | `PASS` | Static source and R6 diff scans found no Context/Policy compiler, audit persistence, runtime process, `process.env` read, environment injection, filesystem/network I/O, adapter, external integration, production operation, destructive behavior, or later-phase implementation. |

### Independent Technical and Adversarial Probes

The accepted independent matrix executed 176 bounded cases and passed all 176. A preliminary negative-oracle run treated `client\\#secret=documentation` as an unsupported-escape acceptance control, but the existing grammar correctly parsed the fragment-delimited `secret=` assignment and rejected it. That preliminary result was discarded; the oracle was narrowed to non-delimiting unsupported escapes and the complete 176-case matrix was rerun without changing candidate artifacts.

| Behavior | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| R6 escaped colon/equal closure | `PASS` | 17 quoted, unquoted, CLI whitespace/equals, npm-style, API-key, client-secret, private-key, auth-token, and refresh-token escaped-colon/equal forms failed closed without sentinel disclosure. This includes six additional bounded forms beyond the 11 checked-in R6 cases. |
| Historical assignment and provider regressions | `PASS` | 15 R1/R2/R3 assignment forms, 12 provider/bearer/private-key/URL credential forms, and seven escaped/encoded R4 forms rejected without raw-value disclosure. |
| Error-surface non-disclosure | `PASS` | 11 semantic and provider-shaped unknown keys returned `SECRET_CONFIG_REJECTED` with `[REDACTED]`; key and sentinel material were absent from message, stack, `configPath`, and serialized error output. |
| Unsupported escape negatives | `PASS` | Three unsupported `+`, `@`, and `/` escaped-label controls remained accepted and byte-retained; R6 did not broaden shell escape normalization beyond the declared separator set. |
| Narrow URL decoding | `PASS` | Three upper/lower-case supported `%5F`, `%2D`, and `%2E` query labels rejected; eight double-encoded, unrelated `%5A` / `%2F` / `%3A` / `%3D`, encoded-value, path-position, and non-query-position controls remained accepted. |
| All nine environment cases | `PASS` | `GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE`, `GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY`, `GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES`, `GIT_INDEX_FILE`, `CCACHE_PREFIX`, `CCACHE_PREFIX_CPP`, `CMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER`, and `CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER` all rejected. |
| Historical environment regressions | `PASS` | 32 JWT, credential-source, Git config/executable/helper, runtime-option, loader, shell, Terraform, OCI, compiler/toolchain, Cargo, registry, and command-prefix names rejected. |
| False-positive controls | `PASS` | 11 benign repository/assignment labels, including keyboard, tokenizer, authors-style, monkey, escaped colon/equal, and unsupported-escape forms, remained accepted. All eight task-safe environment names, including `KEYBOARD_LAYOUT`, `TOKENIZER_MODE`, and `AUTHORS_STYLE`, remained accepted. |
| Narrowing and immutability | `PASS` | 11 checks confirmed empty-baseline policy, no parent inheritance, frozen snapshots, safe ordered narrowing, and five visibility/adapter/environment/timeout/context re-expansion rejections. |
| Canonical serialization and hash | `PASS` | 29 checks matched Node `crypto` for 14 lengths through 4097 bytes, matched `TextEncoder` for eight strings, and confirmed ordering, NFC equivalence, mismatch redaction, cycle/non-finite rejection, and negative-zero normalization. |

### Finding Lifecycle

| Finding | Prior Status | Current Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-001-001` | `RESOLVED` | `RESOLVED` | Historical assignment variants and non-disclosure remain passing on R6. |
| `FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-001-002` | `RESOLVED` | `RESOLVED` | CI JWT and broader historical environment regressions remain passing on R6. |
| `FND-HNS-CORE-005-SECURITY-002-001` | `OPEN` | `OPEN` | Exact value regressions pass; lifecycle ownership remains with `SECURITY_REVIEWER`. |
| `FND-HNS-CORE-005-SECURITY-002-002` | `OPEN` | `OPEN` | Exact key non-disclosure regressions pass; lifecycle ownership remains with `SECURITY_REVIEWER`. |
| `FND-HNS-CORE-005-SECURITY-002-003` | `OPEN` | `OPEN` | Exact environment regressions pass; lifecycle ownership remains with `SECURITY_REVIEWER`. |
| `FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-003-001` | `OPEN` | `RESOLVED` | All 17 independent escaped colon/equal forms reject without disclosure; unsupported escapes, narrow URL-decoding negatives, and benign boundaries remain passing on exact R6 identity. |
| `FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-003-002` | `RESOLVED` | `RESOLVED` | All nine Git redirection, ccache prefix, and CMake launcher cases remain rejected. |
| `FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-003-003` | `RESOLVED` | `RESOLVED` | Benign labels and task-safe environment controls remain accepted without substring overblocking. |

#### FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-003-001 - Generalized secret classifier permits escaped sensitive assignment labels

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Finding ID | `FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-003-001` |
| Severity / Owner | `MAJOR` / `IMPLEMENTER` |
| Prior Status / New Status | `OPEN` / `RESOLVED` |
| Closure Evidence | `REV-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-006`; exact R6 manifest SHA-256 `a45ddb510402dab45b22a3d31b041ba7bbd230da4b3fa47f75b7cf72e4ae7740`; 17 independent escaped colon/equal rejection and non-disclosure cases plus adjacent narrow negative controls. |

The R6 extractor change is limited to the colon/equal escape forms already normalized by `normalizeLabelSeparators`. Quoted, unquoted, CLI, and npm-style labels now reach the boundary-aware sensitive classifier, while unsupported escapes, narrow URL handling, ordinary labels, and safe environment names retain their prior behavior.

### Acceptance Criteria Mapping

| Acceptance Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-REVIEW-006-001` | `PASS` | Exact R6 manifest/hash, direct-parent lineage, R5 supersession, all 15 identities, two replacements, thirteen inherited artifacts, post-candidate immutability, and Maker/Reviewer separation independently verified. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-REVIEW-006-002` | `PASS` | Escaped colon/equal assignments fail closed across quoted, unquoted, CLI, and npm forms with non-disclosure; unsupported escapes, narrow URL decoding, and benign labels do not regress. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-REVIEW-006-003` | `PASS` | All historical TECH and Security regression behaviors, primary/companion contracts, official commands, discovery, canonical hash, narrowing, immutability, environment controls, scope, dependency, and forbidden-capability checks pass. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-REVIEW-006-004` | `PASS` | This execution appends evidence only to `docs/08_agent_reviews/review_log.md`; no reviewed artifact, manifest, Work Item, governance file, or prior evidence was modified. |

### Scope and Limitations

- Reviewer write scope is limited to this append in `docs/08_agent_reviews/review_log.md`; no reviewed artifact, manifest, package, Work Item, governance file, prior evidence, Gate, merge, or lifecycle artifact was modified.
- This is `TECH_REVIEWER` evidence only. It does not act as QA, Security, Gate Checker, Implementer, merger, accepted-risk authority, or release authority.
- Security-owned findings remain `OPEN` pending their assigned Security review despite passing exact regression behavior here. No GateResult is issued by this execution.
- No new TECH finding was identified.

### Decision

`PASS`

R6 has valid provenance, immutable identity, exact scope, green official commands, correct canonical hash behavior, complete historical regression coverage, preserved false-positive and narrow-decoding boundaries, and independent closure of `FND-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-003-001`. The exact R6 candidate satisfies all assigned TECH review acceptance criteria.

### Provenance, Identity, and Prerequisite

| Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Fresh clone / origin / clean start | `PASS` | Fresh single-branch clone at `/tmp/hns-core-005-qa-review-006.fu62YK/repo`; origin exactly `https://github.com/ivan-tsai1207/ai-system-delivery-framework`; starting tree was clean and no user checkout was used or modified. |
| Branch and remote start | `PASS` | Local HEAD and `git ls-remote` both resolved `feature/hns-core-005-config-hash` to `c65ce98d167f2958e1358432e7224ed50e4a9f48`. |
| Independent execution | `PASS` | `REV-HNS-CORE-005-QA-006-EXEC-20260925T212206Z` was absent from prior evidence and differs from all Maker and prior Reviewer execution IDs. |
| Candidate lineage | `PASS` | Candidate exists, is an ancestor of review-start HEAD, has direct parent `7a2b9ab399fde3447a4cdb2ea34974bbf3268d55`, and the 20-commit base-to-candidate range contains no merge commit. |
| Exact manifest binding | `PASS` | Manifest bytes independently hash to the assigned SHA-256; all 15 rows match their declared Git blobs and content SHA-256 values at the candidate and current HEAD. |
| Replacement / inheritance / immutability | `PASS` | R6 replaces exactly `config.ts` and `config.test.mjs`; the other 13 artifacts are inherited. All 15 reviewed artifacts remain byte-identical after the candidate. |
| Same-hash TECH prerequisite | `PASS` | `REV-HNS-CORE-005-TECH-006` records independent `PASS` against this exact manifest SHA-256 and candidate, with a distinct Reviewer execution ID. |

### Commands and Regression Suites

| Command / Suite | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Runtime assertion / `npm ci` | `PASS` | Node `v24.19.0`, npm `11.17.0`; 7 packages added, 8 audited, 0 vulnerabilities. |
| `npm run build` / `npm run typecheck` | `PASS` | Strict TypeScript build and no-emit typecheck completed. |
| Default `npm test` | `PASS` | 137 passed; 0 failed, cancelled, skipped, or todo. Root, core, schema, error, hash, and config suites were discovered. |
| Focused hash / config suites | `PASS` | 41 passed; 0 failed, cancelled, skipped, or todo. |
| HNS-CORE-001 regression | `PASS` | Package smoke/configuration suite: 3 passed; 0 failed/skipped/todo. |
| HNS-CORE-002 regression | `PASS` | Core domain suite: 13 passed; 0 failed/skipped/todo. |
| HNS-CORE-003 regression | `PASS` | Schema suites: 38 passed; 0 failed/skipped/todo. |
| HNS-CORE-004 regression | `PASS` | Error/exit registry suites: 42 passed; 0 failed/skipped/todo. |
| `npm audit --audit-level=high` | `PASS` | 0 vulnerabilities. |
| Test integrity | `PASS` | No `.only`, `.skip`, or `.todo` marker exists under `harness/tests`; no exact count is treated as a permanent contract. |

### Independent Acceptance and Adversarial Probes

The accepted independent matrix passed 198 of 198 bounded checks. A preliminary oracle incorrectly expected four malformed provider-value prefixes and three malformed provider-shaped keys to reject even though they did not meet the providers' token grammar. Those seven expectations were discarded, replaced with well-formed credential forms, and rerun successfully; no candidate artifact changed.

| Behavior | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Escaped assignment regression | `PASS` | 17 quoted, unquoted, CLI, npm-style, API-key, client-secret, private-key, auth-token, and refresh-token escaped colon/equal forms rejected without disclosure. |
| Historical assignment / provider regression | `PASS` | 15 R1-R4 assignment forms and 13 well-formed provider, bearer, private-key, and credential-URL forms rejected without raw-value disclosure. |
| Encoded label boundary | `PASS` | Six supported `%5F`, `%2D`, and `%2E` labels rejected; double-encoded, unrelated encoded separators, path text, and unsupported escapes remained accepted in the false-positive matrix. |
| Diagnostic non-disclosure | `PASS` | 12 secret-shaped unknown keys produced `SECRET_CONFIG_REJECTED` with `[REDACTED]`; key and sentinel text were absent from message, stack, `configPath`, and serialized error output. |
| False-positive controls | `PASS` | 20 benign repository/assignment/path values, including keyboard, tokenizer, authors-style, unsupported escapes, and narrow URL-decoding controls, remained accepted and byte-retained. |
| Environment policy | `PASS` | 53 credential-source, Git redirection/config/helper, runtime loader, shell, compiler/toolchain, Cargo, registry, cloud, production, and token names rejected; eight task-safe names including `KEYBOARD_LAYOUT`, `TOKENIZER_MODE`, and `AUTHORS_STYLE` remained accepted. |
| Narrowing / empty baseline | `PASS` | Ten visibility, adapter, environment, context, timeout, identity, owner, and audit re-expansions rejected; one multi-layer project/invocation narrowing case passed with ordered subsets and `EMPTY` child baseline behavior. |
| Immutability / hostile inputs | `PASS` | Three snapshot/freeze checks and ten array, accessor, symbol, custom-object, duplicate, sparse, and newline-secret hostile cases passed; accessors were not invoked and secret classification preceded generic string rejection. |
| Canonical hash references | `PASS` | 14 byte-length SHA-256 comparisons through 4097 bytes matched Node `crypto`; eight UTF-8 cases matched `TextEncoder`; eight ordering, NFC, mismatch-redaction, cycle, unsupported-value, collision, and negative-zero boundaries passed. |

### Primary and Companion Acceptance Criteria

| Acceptance Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-001` | `PASS` | Focused suite plus independent SHA-256, UTF-8, ordering, NFC, path-independent fixture, and canonical-boundary checks passed. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-002` | `PASS` | Unknown keys and secret values fail closed; host, project, and invocation precedence only narrow; environment propagation uses an explicit empty-baseline allowlist. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-003` | `PASS` | Unicode/path independence, hash mismatch, invalid hash, redacted diagnostics, secret-key surfaces, and newline-bearing secret behavior passed. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-004` | `PASS` | R6 adds no Context/Policy compiler, audit store, runtime process, filesystem/network I/O, environment injection, adapter, dependency, or later-phase capability. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-TEST-DISCOVERY-001` through `-006` | `PASS` | Default `npm test` discovered root, core, schema, error, hash, and config suites. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-TEST-DISCOVERY-007` | `PASS` | All 137 discovered tests passed with 0 failed/cancelled/skipped/todo; no source, test, schema, dependency, or lockfile change was made by the discovery artifact. |

### Historical Finding Regression

### Assigned QA Acceptance Criteria

| Acceptance Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-QA-REVIEW-006-001` | `PASS` | Same-hash R6 TECH PASS, exact manifest binding, all 15 identities, lineage, immutability, and independent execution were verified. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-QA-REVIEW-006-002` | `PASS` | Every primary and companion AC and all historical finding behaviors passed independently. |
| `AC-HNS-CORE-005-QA-REVIEW-006-003` | `PASS` | False positives, diagnostics, immutability, narrowing, hostile/negative cases, environment policy, and encoded/escaped boundaries passed. |

### Findings, Scope, and Limitations

- No new QA finding was identified.
- R6 candidate scope is exactly two authorized files with 38 insertions and 5 deletions. It changes no package, lockfile, dependency, manifest, governance, capability, or forbidden path.
- This execution appends only this evidence to `docs/08_agent_reviews/review_log.md`; no reviewed artifact, manifest, Work Item, prior evidence, governance file, Gate, or lifecycle record was modified.
- Security-owned findings remain `OPEN` until their assigned `SECURITY_REVIEWER` execution. This QA decision does not close them and is not a GateResult, merge, release, or accepted-risk decision.

### Decision

`PASS`

The exact R6 candidate satisfies every assigned primary, companion, historical-regression, and QA acceptance criterion. Identity, same-hash TECH prerequisite, default and focused discovery, prior CORE regressions, escaped/encoded credential boundaries, non-disclosure, false-positive controls, environment policy, narrowing, immutability, hostile inputs, scope, and forbidden-capability checks all pass independently.
